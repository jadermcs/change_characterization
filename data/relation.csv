mean					I mean I did have some of the boxes in there until I sort of, thought while I was sorting things out.	The name Grob Mitzer mean anything ?	unchanged
judge					It was, he judged, almost twenty feet long and obviously served the triple purpose of sitting room, working place and office.	There the similarity ends, since judging from his writings Bagehot was a roaring snob, whereas judging from his heckles the heckler was not.	unchanged
prepare					She sat down and prepared to wait as long as was necessary.	And I'm not prepared to go on paying three thousand a year renting it to give to him when I could be buying one myself.	unchanged
remain					The techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do.	But the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational, uncivilized, and criminal instincts.	unchanged
set					Moreover, the advent of low-cost, high-density-storage devices like CD-ROMs may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power : a CD-ROM, for instance, can hold about 600 megabytes (i.e. 10&sup6; bytes), can be reproduced currently for about Ì´å£1 and read on a device costing about Ì´å£400.	If the PNC Declaration of Independence constituted a major landmark in this process, the time has come to embark on another major step, that of declaring the setting up of a state or government structure.	unchanged
include					DOZENS more East German refugees arrived outside the West German embassy yesterday seeking asylum and passage to the West, including some who missed by only a few minutes a train that took more than 800 of their compatriots to West Germany.	Is the cooker included or not ?	unchanged
state					However, Caithness himself stated that this first selection was in no way a definitive list	Finally, after the third month passed with no rent received, Debbie phoned the tenants, asked them to pay her directly, and sent Landlords a recorded-delivery letter, which was returned, and finally one by ordinary post stating that Landlords were no longer employed as the managing agents.	unchanged
sit					You could feel the atmosphere when you were sat in the car.	Way you go, Patty, he said softly, and the dog was off, hurling herself along the embankment, all paws and flying ears, after a rabbit who had been sitting in a patch of sun but disappeared with contemptuous ease as she came close.	unchanged
catch					Catch it, one two three catch it, one two three.	They offered opportunities for men of skill to acquire great position in the world Arnoul of Ardres caught the eye of Countess Ida of Boulogne through his exploits; and they also conferred lustre on the great Geoffrey le Bel and Philip of Alsace were throughout France for their distinguished performances in these show battles.	unchanged
provide					Nell would never rest until she could get closer to confirm her worst suspicions, and paradoxically it was the woman in her that provided the intensity of emotion that would let nothing stand in her way.	It is the doctor that provides the remedy.	unchanged
hear					It's just that I can actually hear it.	No general election was fought by the organization set up after 1911, but there is little doubt that there was a massive improvement; criticisms that were commonplace in 1910 were not to be heard by 1913.	unchanged
discuss					Notwithstanding current problems which they discussed lightly, it had all been wonderful.	(The requirements of causation in the criminal law are discussed elsewhere.)	unchanged
lead					The unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems due to non-harmonization even of commonly used variables, e.g. eight different definitions of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the Member States and maximum temperature at each weather station was defined in at least four different ways;	The sharply reduced number of 16-18-year-olds will inevitably lead employers to bid up the wages of that age group to entice young people away from education and into unskilled or semi-skilled jobs.	unchanged
need					Oh I need some	It needs tidying up but you can see that the price	unchanged
come					Francis Morgan stood and stared at them, and even before the man stepped forward steadily, hand extended, mouth opening to speak, he understood who they were and what they had come to tell him.	They were expensive to buy and came a day late.	unchanged
concern					For instance, one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation, a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission lines as noted earlier.	The two companies concerned are trying to record the spoken word.	unchanged
assist					Probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course comes in the fifth session when Somerset practitioners take the logic of working with the problem in the community to its ultimate conclusion.	His personal preference for sculling over rowing assisted the introduction of quadruple sculls to world championship and Olympic competition.	unchanged
look					Sorge looked round the table, saw their undisguised curiosity.	Look here, there is another question that comes to mind.	unchanged
promise					Last week he promised to supply us with a written explanation of the way his company had treated Debbie, but it never arrived.	Wales's instant reaction, a try by Arthur Emyr, and subsequent steady improvement, bringing well-crafted tries for Emyr and Robert Jones, promised more than was later fulfilled.	unchanged

gain					The findings were documented in a report A Place For All Our Children (CCUF 1983) and an analysis was prepared of the practical and bureaucratic problems in gaining an ordinary childcare place for a child with special needs, with suggestions for how these might be overcome.	Indeed, working directly with consultants proves invaluable in gaining access to high-quality morbidity data.	unchanged
ignore					Sir : I was interested by your juxtaposition of Poll predicts 42-seat majority for Labour with Tories hold on (30 September), the latter referring, of course, to the Conservative victory in Wandsworth, the significance of which appears to have been almost totally ignored by the media.	When New Zealand last toured Ireland in 1978 Leinster were ignored.	unchanged
shiver					Yet given what we have learned about links between the security services and the Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, and the deep suspicion about surrogate murders, you can't shrug off the shiver Conlon's words bring.	It was raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery, the pines bowing and shivering in the wind.	unchanged

call					The people of Munich call their version of Weissbier breakfast beer and have it with a pair of coddled veal sausages.	Since it is the equation formula that needs to be satisfied, we should choose the potential as a vector (called, not without logic, the vector potential), defined by the equation formula.	unchanged

collect					Since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems, collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise;	Miss Williams took him to meet the police Land Rover at the stable gate, a bone-thin, wiry woman in her late fifties, her expression sufficiently forbidding to prevent the parents, edging cars through the gate to collect children from the ten o'clock ride, from asking any questions.	unchanged

cover					The very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the USA (Collins 1981), where planning is required up to 16 km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes.	William IX's crusade of 1101 brought about serious financial problems in Aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in the hitherto stable currency; and Robert Curthose's decision to mortgage Normandy to William Rufus in order to cover his crusading expenses exacerbated a conflict over the duchy which was not settled until the death of his son William Clito in 1128.	unchanged
stand					Move in there but let her stand	The farm stands on a spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forest, and within 10 minutes I had turned my back on the corduroy battalions of trees and was striding under a still, cloudy sky over tussocks of rush and coarse grass, with my face to the long, bare shoulders of open hillside that flank the winding shallows of the East Kielder Burn.	unchanged
move					and he claims to be er able to move things and do the poltergeist stunt, you know ?	(When he became Chancellor of the Exchequer this practice caused consternation at the Treasury, when he used only a page of notes to assist him in moving complicated resolutions on wartime finance; he relied successfully on his memory to provide details and figures.)	unchanged
ring					He rang and there was only a short delay before Alice Mair opened the door.	Then, from behind me, an unfamiliar voice sounded : Oh, ring my bells.	unchanged
hold					She flushed, but held on to the phone.	Was it the faint smell of herbs and newly baked dough, the soft ticking of the wall-mounted clock which seemed both to mark the passing seconds and yet to hold time in thrall, the rhythmic moaning of the sea through the half-open door, the sense of well-fed ease conveyed by the two cushioned armchairs, the open hearth ?	unchanged
wonder					He kept wondering how it had got Silk.	He paused, reminding McLeish irresistibly of a Labrador wondering how best to approach an acquaintance.	unchanged
pack					He was unsurprised to find her packed off firmly to take his sister home, leaving him as a person of major importance in what he instantly assumed to be a real murder.	These are not moments of thirst but nor are they causes of drunkenness (unless one tries to pack all such experiences into one day).	unchanged
grasp					Anthony, recognizing incompetence, grasped Dalgliesh's hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek, so soft that it was like the fall of a petal.	Again Law succeeded by unorthodoxy; he was quick to grasp the essentials of an opponent's argument and quite prepared to be rude or direct if the situation demanded it.	unchanged
appear					The Home Office is not bound by those opinions, and appears to depart from them frequently.	In parliament he was wont to abandon an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point had been made; the speeches that appear in Hansard were touched up by his staff, and his speeches in the country were given to the press in advance.	unchanged
play					The examples described below illustrate all these, though as yet there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which GIS has played a significant part.	The voices played with the slaughter of the innocents, treble and descant hunting each other, while she bowed her head, unable to sing in tune.	unchanged
show					They propose a national radiological spatial information system and, in a pilot project in Cumbria, have integrated several layers of data within ARC/INFO to show what this might involve (Fig. 10.2).	It must be shown that the defendant intended (which, again, includes both purpose and awareness of practical certainty) to cause really serious injury to someone.	unchanged
start					Each WRA is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear.	Allan Ahlberg says : In the past, a lot of children's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant framed in a gallery, but when you tried to read the book, there was nothing there, because the words started as a coat-hanger to hang pictures on.	unchanged
decide					His problem will be that Mrs Thatcher might decide to do it first, and then she will garner the votes.	AN IMPASSIONED appeal for Labour to back electoral reform was made by a leading Shadow Cabinet member yesterday after the national executive decided overwhelmingly to oppose a proportional representation motion.	unchanged
found					Keller was made a Steward of Henley Royal Regatta in 1976, a time when the proliferation of new six-lane, still-water courses around the world, which had emerged under his guidance, seemed a threat to the regatta founded in 1829.	However, the Pope's account of the role of the papacy went a great deal farther than that : Christian unity, he said, must be founded on the faith in Christ that was handed on by the Apostles; what this faith is must be determined by the Roman Catholic Church.	unchanged
form					Attention should be drawn to the three Annual Reports of the Hazardous Waste Inspectorate (now merged with other branches of the DoE to form Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution).	A mile above the shepherd's hut the hillsides ceased their upward rolling and curved together to form a dead-end valley of broad-breasted slopes five miles from the nearest tarmac road, hidden deep in the folds of the moors.	unchanged

contain					These contain some valuable material on disposal practices, and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority (WRA) counties in England, districts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.	This system currently runs in dBASE II and contains in excess of 3000 items of professionally assessed information on major hazards coded into some 24 separate fields.	unchanged
expect					This was the essence of the problem : the press could only be managed by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to Central Office to search for news.	Ninety per cent of his party's cash comes from the unions, which will expect a return.	unchanged
undertake					The specialist social worker and another under-fives worker with a personal interest in the issues undertook a supplementary review to examine resources for these children.	It's very exciting and gets the adrenalin going, says David Phillip, whose firm usually undertakes auctions in the Otley area.	unchanged
pull					I was calling Sweetman's bluff, confident he would not dare pull the trigger, and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn him into mincemeat.	The one they missed pulled out from Warsaw's East Station at 2.50am yesterday carrying 809 cheering East Germans bound for the Rhine region of West Germany.	unchanged
indicate					In no way, however, does this invalidate the need for microscale studies for instance, while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may suggest causes of them, only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring.	True, the new Secretary of State for the Environment laid stress, from the outset, on the need for economic regeneration, and indicated his sympathy for the voluntary sector in the tackling of urban problems.	unchanged

produce					Inside The Brotherhood (Granada), produced by Claudia Milne and Martin Short, dug into the most notorious area of Masonic influence, local government.	My Dress Hangs There (1939) (Fig. 10) is one of the artist s most formally adventurous works, mixing photographic collage with paint to produce a critique of North American culture.	unchanged
create					IN December, 1943, the men working feverishly to create the first American atomic bomb sent a team of spooks to Naples.	Thus, even if it would be excessive to sweep large numbers of the deaths now recorded as accidents into the law of homicide, there may be sufficient justification for creating or enforcing offences designed to ensure safe conditions of work, safe goods, safe buildings, and so on.	unchanged
stay					An important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away, rather than relying on the 19 official evacuation reception centres.	He stayed in, and the recession worsened.	unchanged
help					You're gon na help me, you're gon na stay here I'm afraid	Experience with practical calculations helps, but even after years of work one usually remains this side of infallibility.	unchanged
keep					The boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead the riding-school only used the land by grace of its owner and it was a shooting estate but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come to his call.	Given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise.	unchanged
organise					all sorts of things organised	FISA was then a relatively unimportant body which organised European and other championships and participated in the running of Olympic regattas.	unchanged
increase					Parents also wanted an increased availability of specialist therapy time, but wanted it to be used in a more flexible way.	The poem highlights two important twelfth-century developments : the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime (the fruit of princely peace-keeping), and the increasing significance of siege-engines in warfare.	unchanged
begin					The Suffolk police had begun hunting up previous owners of Wyvis Hall and they had been alerted that a Verne-Smith lived in their area.	He always felt that effective musical criticism began by being well written, and he never lost his liveliness.	unchanged
declare					The divergence was sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction, the fruit of Augustinian theology, amplified as the century went on by canon and Roman law reference; princes pronounced their campaigns just wars (fought against aggressors with the aim of re-establishing peace) or public wars (declared by a competent authority in the public interest), while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace.	If the PNC Declaration of Independence constituted a major landmark in this process, the time has come to embark on another major step, that of declaring the setting up of a state or government structure.	unchanged
give					If I give you a bit of paper and the lot, yeah well you know what to do and go to school and fill them in !	After being given clearance to land, Miranda, following her instructor's directions, started her approach; she throttled back to reduce speed and control her descent as she flew towards the threshold the point just before she intended to touch down.	unchanged
accord					The impact, according to Henning Albrechsten, president of Telecottages International who has been involved in their development since the outset, was immediate.	Most animals today do seem to have bodies that accord well with the functions they have to carry out to survive : flyers are aerodynamically efficient, active swimmers have suitable streamlining, herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food, and so on.	unchanged
throw					As they drew back up the stairs, piling on the pieces she threw up at them, Lawton sniffed.	More disturbingly, in The Mask (1945) (Fig. 7), she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portraits as revealing of her inner emotions.	unchanged
face					There was an open roll-top desk facing one of the wide windows and, to its right, a stable door, the top half open, gave a view of the paved courtyard.	Ulster, the provincial champions, may well fancy their chances on November 21, but Leinster look certain to face an uphill struggle even though the tourists have rested 13 of the team that beat Wales.	unchanged

survey					In contrast to his sisters, Anthony was over-clad, a bundle of leggings, jumper and a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead, beneath which he surveyed their busyness, unsmiling, like a stout imperious Caesar.	The survey was not published yet because it was missing important citations.	unchanged
confused					And he said I was completely confused and I couldn't, he said I was trying to shout my wife and erm and, er, you know my mouth wouldn't work, he said, but she said fortunately she looked through the window and er found him and they took him to hospital.	The situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself computer-based.	unchanged
drive					On an impulse he reversed the Jaguar and drove quickly back to Martyr's Cottage.	But the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational, uncivilized, and criminal instincts.	unchanged
observe					Why is it then that we have no difficulties in practice in observing magnetic fields ?	The basic social contract, whereby citizens enjoy certain rights including health care, decent education and housing and a job in return for which they observe the rule of law, was breaking down.	unchanged
examine					Jones et al. (1989) have examined the distribution of some 8500 landslides in the UK.	In the process it will be necessary to examine not only the extent to which geographic issues feature on the policy issues agenda in these fields but also the institutional context which governs decision-making and the extent to which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes.	unchanged
handle					In the UK (see Petts 1988 for a splendid overview) the Health and Safety Executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances in excess of threshold limits are handled.	First, it would bring Britain into line with the best European practice, notably in Germany where local, regional and federal labour courts handle problems in a fair, dispassionate way based on law, precedent and judicial expertise in the labour field.	unchanged
destroy					Although much of the fine detail can be seen most of the tissue of the leaf is destroyed.	The structure of the developing national authority has been both diffuse enough to prevent it from being destroyed by any one single sweep of arrests (there have been more than 50,000 arrests since the Intifada's outbreak), and coherent enough to allow for the existence of a unified resistance strategy.	unchanged

remind					She reminded him of pictures of the young Elizabeth Tudor, the same red-gold hair framing a curiously adult face both secretive and self-composed, the same sharp nose and wary eyes.	There was a field of poppies and corn which reminded him only of small and large, faded and ghostly versions of Van Gogh's " Harvest " which he had seen repeated in endless hospital corridors, waiting rooms, school offices.	unchanged
associate					Meanwhile bad housing, bad sanitation, lack of education, and other perennial ills associated with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leaders and social reformers.	UNTIL six or seven years ago, outsiders associated East Anglia with fens, flatness and the vanished Edwardian nannies of Frinton.	unchanged
secure					It originates from an Italian request to the Council of Ministers in 1973 to identify environmentally balanced and unbalanced areas in the Community; the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and, though by 1981 it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one, funding for this was not secured until 1985.	Mr Justice Hutchison said the 1936 Act primarily envisages a system where the local authority has a power and a duty to try to secure that premises are not in a state which constitutes a statutory nuisance.	unchanged

Amiel is the first reputable dealer to be prosecuted, but more than 100 others as well as auction houses across America are now under subpoena to explain what they thought they were selling.	unchanged

suggest					Some researchers suggest that hazards (and emergencies that might result) can be regarded as either natural or technological.	The construction of this giant-eyed trilobite suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom, and possibly in the surface waters of the sea.	unchanged
cancel					The passages it cancelled had, in any case, as in certain programmes, not been lost but stored on some limbo disc from whence they must now be retrieved.	The currents, on the other hand, do not cancel because they represent opposite charges moving in opposite directions (remember, minus one times minus one is equal to plus one).	unchanged

wait					He then ordered a car to call for him the next morning for a similar occasion and was felled by a stroke while waiting for the lift.	His job was to convince Amaldi to pack his bags because there was a ship waiting at Naples to take him to the United States.	unchanged
cope					The odds are favourable enough according to Chelsea's Mike Hazard, who said of his adversary : He could cope in Poland, not just because of his ability to close people down and use the ball well, but temperament you saw when he scored the goal that won Arsenal the League.	The wonderful thing about the human mind, Adam thought, is the way it copes when the worst happens.	unchanged

Indeed, throughout September and October 1985, and during the following months, the imagery of race continued to dominate debate about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots.	unchanged
quote					He went on to quote the response that had been received from editors :	The Mirror described the estate as Living Hell, and quoted one resident as saying that You've no idea how awful daily life is (8 October 1985).	unchanged
attend					About 230 people attended the conference, held in April 1985.	The average man is a cool, common person, with a considerate air, with figures in his mind, with his own business to attend to, with a set of ordinary opinions arising from and suited to ordinary life.	unchanged
swing					It swung open at his touch but closing it, as always, was more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar sensation of having turned his back on the workaday world and entered country which, no matter how frequent his visits, would always be alien territory.	The balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits.	unchanged
work					Probably the best illustration of the assisting method in action during the course comes in the fifth session when Somerset practitioners take the logic of working with the problem in the community to its ultimate conclusion.	Mrs Bottomley is convinced the Tory victory provides the opportunity to entrench the reforms and to give doctors, nurses and managers the confidence to make them work.	unchanged

rap					Kahlo's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of Mexico's colonised past : La Llorona the weeping woman of popular myth and La Chingada, the raped and abused mother described in Paz's The Labyrinth of Solitude.	The Indian Mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child.	unchanged
recognize					Indeed, no major studies of evacuation due to hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify.	Further afield, we need to recognize that some disasters (most obviously Chernobyl) will have implications for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take place with some kind of international co-ordination.	unchanged
light					Sweetman paused again, this time to light a long pale blue cigarette with a slim gold lighter.	He stopped, abruptly, as he remembered a conversation earlier that week, and lit a cigarette, thinking furiously.	unchanged

wear					He was a sensible and capable boy, an eldest child, so he moved closer, trying not to breathe, and stood steadfastly looking until he was confident of what he had seen : a body, must be a girl because it was wearing a skirt, lying face down, head towards the bottom of the embankment as if she had dived off the top.	He wore that mantle well at Rome University until his retirement in 1978.	unchanged

wish					If, for instance, we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion, assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require, for example, a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models, epidemiology and population distribution.	In the sections to follow the stark question is therefore put Is the Probation Service in the business of inflicting pain ? and the answer which unfolds may be summarized No, because it neither aspires nor wishes to !	unchanged

invite					Invite.	At a time when the Home Secretary is inviting the Probation Service to move centre stage in the Criminal Justice System (NACRO, 1990, p. 17) it may seem misguided and unnecessarily pedantic to take issue with the White Paper's notion of punishment.	unchanged

note					As noted above, the work of Fedra (1989) is a major step in this direction, and links need to be forged between initiatives in the UK and the rest of Europe.	She still retained her English habit of noting each day's weather, always expecting changes, marvelling at the hot sunny days which followed one after the other, almost with monotony.	unchanged
lift					There is a poignant irony in the way clothing, which on one level served to hide Kahlo's broken body, falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique (Fig. 4).	As Israel's authority was being lifted, the population began creating an alternative authority of their own.	unchanged
sign					This is plainly evident from the section of the contract signed by each participant where what is expected of them is spelt out :	We knew that the US Government had signed 453 treaties with the Indians and broken every one.	unchanged
predict					Moreover, commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine, notably to predict crop yields in the main grain-growing areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures.	Under these conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated, and of course our model is unable to predict the detailed behaviour of the particles.	unchanged
exist					This may sound utopian, but it has been borne out by the experience of existing telecottages.	In effect, therefore, the PLO exists at all levels of organisation within the occupied territories.	unchanged
express					McLeish expressed qualified enthusiasm and Charlie assured him he felt exactly the same about his younger brother.	In an ideal world, there would be no need for either, but for now I would rather see the frustration expressed in these light-hearted terms than in the sort of man-hating bitterness that has given feminism such a bad name.	unchanged
drop					They reached the main deck, dropping down	Rufus overtook a bus going to Colchester and dropped the two in the back so that they could catch it.	unchanged
fumble					Frightened that it was a gas pocket, he fumbled with his mask, and finally got it back on.	Frederica did not attempt to ascertain the fumbled name, having given up interest in stray new people until it was clear that they were of real concern.	unchanged
whistle					Still whistling, Buzz laid the tray.	Forster's breathing whistled out of the one-way valve.	unchanged
make					Moreover, the advent of low-cost, high-density-storage devices like CD-ROMs may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power : a CD-ROM, for instance, can hold about 600 megabytes (i.e. 10&sup6; bytes), can be reproduced currently for about Ì´å£1 and read on a device costing about Ì´å£400.	Why they keep on making new bulbs ?	unchanged
assess					Once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk.	This system currently runs in dBASE II and contains in excess of 3000 items of professionally assessed information on major hazards coded into some 24 separate fields.	unchanged
visit					Tory ministers, like Michael Heseltine who visited Meadowell last November, say the cash shortages are due to council profligacy and bad management.	EACH new indignity in the heap visited on Welsh rugby seems worse than the last.	unchanged
burst					He burst out laughing.	Of medium height and packed with energy, even distressed as he was, he was bursting round the kitchen, hair still damp at the back from his swim.	unchanged
grow					But you know how it is, it's family ties and kids growing up and then they grow up and have families of their own, then you get tied to the grandchildren or what have you.	Rising unemployment turned a lingering and growing malaise into a crisis.	unchanged
define					Allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre; districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons in order to define specific areas of interest (districts) and to summarize their characteristics; routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network, the arcs of which can be assigned weights according to road conditions, road capacity and so on.	DEFINING MURDER : THE INCLUSIONARY QUESTION	unchanged
avoid					As for the others, avoiding them had presented no problems.	Punters often try to avoid paying.	unchanged
learnt					Let us hope that G1S can, in some small way, help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which, as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the UK, can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places.	The Independent has learnt that 1,800 American Roman Catholic nuns wrote last winter to Dr Runcie, urging him to defy the Pope over the ordination of women.	unchanged
enjoy					The churches built on wool : Angela Lambert enjoys the riches at the heart of East Anglia	Second, it would ensure that workers enjoyed positive rights under law and reduce the emphasis of union immunities.	unchanged
argue					In essence, they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework.	The article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character of current probation work and argues that, to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community, the probation officer's employment of established social work knowledge, skills, and values is a strength not a weakness.	unchanged
tear					Bloody clashes would occur whenever armoured units raided these villages, storming through makeshift defensive road blocks and responding to rocks being thrown with live bullets and tear gas; but no sooner would these army units be gone than authority would revert to the village residents.	He gave him a hand with a large oil drum, and then another, as Nell, tearing herself from her appointed task, dragged over a bench.	unchanged
generate					Certainly, in terms of the volume of waste generated in the UK non-nuclear hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda; while less than 1 million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in 1985åäÌÝÌÕ86, 10 times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes (Openshaw et al. 1989 : 13).	These ideas were informed by a paper which had already been produced by an active member of the local Mencap group, who had previously tried to generate the debate within the Community Health Service through the Mencap committee.	unchanged
name					In 1942, in Germany, we had a GRU network named the Rote Kapelle	In the churchyard in his last parish a family in the English 1870s had tried to name a son Walter Cornelius Brittain and had buried three, aged five, aged two, aged one month, interspersed by variegated dead daughters, a Jennet, a Marian, an Eva.	unchanged
draw					He describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the UK and illustrates their application with reference to examples drawn from retail analysis and store location, market research, credit rating and target marketing.	First, attention should be drawn to the new directive from the Department of Health to regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population.	unchanged
dominate					Finally, the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone.	Gene Autry, the first TV cowboy, now 82, says westerns dominated the early days of TV partly because they had lively, cheaply produced visuals, but mainly because early TV was starved of feature films by the studios.	unchanged
hang					On one long wall hung a row of Van Goghs, including an Arles " Poets' Garden " he hadn't seen before, but recognised, from small photographs, from charged descriptions in the painter's letters.	She said, hang on	unchanged
pop					Pop him on the shoulder.	He sat back, pulled off his mask, and popped the sweet into his mouth.	unchanged

distribute					The fuzzy nature of much geographically distributed data, the inherent errors in it, the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future;	Since 1986 Rytasha has broken awayfrom her guru and set up on her own with a charity called Food Relief International, which raises money from the fiercely competitive matrons of Palm Beach and distributes it to the starving people of Bangladesh.	unchanged
arrive					Electors are always prepared to criticise the Government in answer to pollsters' questions, but when the same individuals arrive at the polling booth they simply can not bring themselves to vote Labour into power.	There is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system.	unchanged
believe					I believed the genre was still an important and powerful one.	Because the networks believe westerns appeal mainly to middle-aged men, Young Riders has a cast of five pouting young male actors, in an attempt to make a western with good demographics.	unchanged
suffer					Four of the absentees suffered the squirming discomfort of being among the Welsh squad.	At the same time, the residents of the poorest areas have to suffer, in a way that is not true of those who live elsewhere, a growing fear of attack on themselves or their property.	unchanged
find					Next morning Ruth was down in the kitchen early, eagerly hoping to find Sean there.	He had trouble finding an appropriate language for the painter's obsession with the illuminated material world.	unchanged
reduce					Jamie, through a renewed queasiness, just observed that the police driver was instantly reduced to half his age by Miss Williams's greeting.	Miss Williams's natural pitch, well suited to reaching across a hunting-field, was discreetly reduced.	unchanged
obtain					Adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an English newspaper while away.	The magnetic field may be obtained from AmpÌÎåÂre's law (eqn (3.21)) as follows formula, where the line integral is taken over the circle of radius a (Fig. 3.2), I is the total current of the beam and formula is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the cylindrical coordinate system specified by formula].	unchanged
avert					From the pine wood he simply averted his eyes till later.	Delaney averted his gaze from her, afraid of what he had seen in her eyes.	unchanged
consult					He watched his aunt and Miss Williams wordlessly consult each other, but knew his aunt would do as she was told; successful solicitor though she was, she was ten years younger than Miss Williams and, as she complained, totally intimidated by her as she had not been by anyone since her late headmistress.	However, for details of disposal the individual site licences must be consulted.	unchanged
consider					Its continued presence always surprised him since it served no purpose that he could see except symbolically to cut off the headland and to give travellers pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue.	It would seem that, despite the costs involved, they should consider investing in the very detailed digital data (Pinpoint Address Code (PAC)) provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd.	unchanged
perform					Marriott was the chirpy Cockney sparrer who lead The Small Faces, who performed that strange pigeon-toed shuffle on Top of the Pops and wrote Lazy Sunday Afternoon.	If the fossil is constructed in a certain way, then there are only a limited number of jobs that the structure could perform.	unchanged
knock					For geographers who span the conventional (and now archaic) dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change, the redistributions in trade, health and wealth which they will bring about and the knock on effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment.	Is it knocking on something ?	unchanged
recommend					Considerations of this kind have led the House of Lords Select Committee on Murder and Life Imprisonment to recommend the abolition of the mandatory sentence for murder.	The executive is recommending rejection of a motion calling for unilateral disarmament.	unchanged
occur					Despite this, the evacuation was successful, partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated.	An earlier film by Raphael, The Persuaders (1986), charted the transformation of Ricki into Rytasha, which occurred at the Hare Krishna Temple in London, and her uneasy relationship with her guru there.	unchanged
refuse					By the time his aunt arrived Jamie was so far recovered as to be able to refuse to go home and to point out, severely, that he would be needed, either to assist the police or to be lead rider in the eleven-thirty class, or possibly both.	Half an hour after the inspector left, as if to prove his point, the lavatory refused to flush.	unchanged
feed					Active swimmers in the surface waters of the present oceans are likely to feed directly on the plankton, and the trilobites may have had a method of harvesting large quantities of minute food.	Too much specialisation is bad for systems development; it feeds the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulties and forget about the underlying business needs.	unchanged
lay					Considerable stress is laid by the Commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agencies and with states adjacent to the Community's borders.	Prior to laying the information Mrs Bujok had not served an abatement notice upon the council or informed them of the alleged defects in the premises.	unchanged
stir					Perhaps a shimmering dry Martini cocktail (minimum dilution, stirred, not shaken; and served straight up) looks even more refreshing, though its effect is that of a silver mallet.	We stirred it up, yes, but we never lost any money for anybody and we never added to the unemployment figures.	unchanged
smother					In contrast, the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of Tristan da Cunha became the focus of global interest when, during October 1961, the island's lobster processing plant was smothered and the 300 people of the island's only settlement were evacuated to the UK.	A neat step-over by Rocastle sent Thomas hurtling in on goal but Rhodes moved sharply off his line to smother the shot.	unchanged
describe					The techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do.	The next section describes attempts to create a clear under-fives policy.	unchanged
submit					It was submitted that an owner can not turn his back on his property because when he purchases and takes on the responsibility of letting, he knows the property will in the course of time deteriorate.	Bracken House, the former home of the Financial Times, became the first candidate and English Heritage then submitted some 70 recommendations to the Department of the Environment; these included Bankside.	unchanged
assemble					And he tells how none of the assembled guards and officials could look his father in the eye as he protested his innocence.	The standard method of producing task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks at various levels on cards and then assemble the cards in a network.	unchanged
permit					Characteristically, the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated; modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential;	It has now been copied into INGRES, a relational database management system, permitting queries to be made about subsets of the data; for instance, all males between the ages of 25 and 64 suffering from laryngeal cancer.	unchanged
strike					The House of Lords confirmed this rule in Cunningham (1981) : D struck his victim on the head a number of times with a chair, causing injuries from which the victim died a week later.	And now he was passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox and it struck him that the whole headland had the desolate look of an old battlefield, the corpses long since carted away but the air vibrating still with the gunfire of long-lost battles, while the power station loomed over it like a grandiose modern monument to the unknown dead.	unchanged
travel					One answer sometimes given is that they are not, because a driver who overtakes on a bend, knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction, should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue.	Since charged particles rarely travel close to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic forces are by orders of magnitude smaller than the electric forces.	unchanged
search					They are more likely to be stopped and searched, and to be the victim of mistaken arrest or conviction.	After a few more minutes she became restless, and stood up again, her eyes searching the slope of the hillside and the valley below, trying to determine whether some small movement down there was a man on horseback or merely a trick of her imagination.	unchanged
concentrated					Much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system.	Reactions to the riots have concentrated on a number of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred.	unchanged
receive					Trepper was interrogated by the Gestapo and we believed he became a double agent, a lot of misinformation was received in Moscow.	It should be noted that there are frequently major discrepancies between the regional registries and the specialist registries, partly because the latter receive notifications directly from consultants.	unchanged
planning					Its architect had spent the war years with fellow Royal Academicians planning the orderly and spacious London of the future, free of smoke and industry.	Ellen and I lingered on in Mama Sipcott's for another hour and a half; indulging in the sailor's shorebound pastime of planning the perfect voyage.	unchanged
underpin					More than that, it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies.	But they will take into account the need for that balance that says that social spending without underpinning by economic growth will not be sustained in any event.	unchanged
identify					Whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies, developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances, or monitoring the health implications of a disaster, GIS can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions.	THIS expanded network of popular committees and institutions making up the Unified leadership is infused by tens of thousands of activists who belong to, or identify with, the different factions of the PLO.	unchanged
stumble					In the passage, she stumbled and almost fell, then flung back the door to the bedroom.	They didn't want the Yanks stumbling in and screwing up in an attempt to force the issue.	unchanged
enable					The British were involved with them through us and it was their advanced work on breaking cyphers that enabled the ring to establish such a great record.	The Government will also encourage more family doctors to hold budgets to buy services for patients, and is looking at ways to enable smaller practices to team up to secure the advantages of fund holding.	unchanged
deny					Scott was so pleased with the style he had evolved at Battersea, a treatment that humanised industrial forms without denying their function, that he also used it on the Guinness Factory at Park Royal, west London.	The same thing happened in 1984 when the province was denied a fixture against the Wallabies.	unchanged
constitute					The development of the Somerset AEC both accords with and constitutes a practical example of the Home Office's recent guidance to sentencers :	Such measures constituted the present Government's heritage, when it took office in 1979.	unchanged

check					We have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results, let alone of predictions.	He stood, door in hand, checked by something in the way his visitors, a man and a woman, were standing.	unchanged
represent					While criticized by many on the grounds that it had few teeth and represented a compromise between the DoE and all other departments (notably those of Agriculture and of Transport), it was none the less a major achievement.	They represent a time when either their objects were not the same as those of the official organization, or the CCO was not enterprising enough to suit them.	unchanged
run					He stopped on the embankment, shaking with cold and shock, to note the spot, then fled along the tractor paths, the dog running with him, to the stables where the ten o'clock children's ride was in its closing stages.	Yeah the Stratford Warriors running about every six weeks something like that.	unchanged
march					We thought they were like any other wartime group, nothing more than reminiscences and marching songs.	Both women looked at him in joint appeal and he marched to the door, pulling it open with unnecessary force.	unchanged
save					This has been a constant theme of Intifada policy : that we wish to build (Palestine), not to destroy (Israel); that we wish to achieve freedom (for our people), not to deprive others (Israelis) of it; that we wish to protect and save lives (ours), not to endanger the lives of others (Israelis).	It's just that I'm saving.	unchanged

And on that one is er, sixty three shared by nine six time sixty three divided by nine	unchanged
step					So here he was, a distinguished public man, also an artist of a kind, stepping obediently through Room I (French 1880s) and Room II (British 1880s and 1890s), on a lead grey morning, to the pale grey, classical, quiet place where the bright light shone and sang off pigment so that the phrase, miraculous stuff, seemed merely accurate.	Only once had he returned after they all left and that had been bad enough, like a dream no, like stepping into the set and scenario of some frightening film, a Hitchcock movie perhaps.	unchanged
send					And erm we sent it to well one of my other sons in Australia there and he was thrilled to bits.	Finally, after the third month passed with no rent received, Debbie phoned the tenants, asked them to pay her directly, and sent Landlords a recorded-delivery letter, which was returned, and finally one by ordinary post stating that Landlords were no longer employed as the managing agents.	unchanged
prevent					But it should be possible to create and enforce enough common rules to prevent the absurd see-sawing of industrial relations legislation we have seen since 1969.	Neither the Butler Education Act of 1944, nor the introduction of comprehensive schools, prevented a high proportion of children from under-achieving.	unchanged

list					The operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks.	Esso filling stations have a free booklet listing most models produced since 1980, as does the charity Clear (01-387 4970), with more detail available in the Unleaded Petrol Guide (Autodale, Ì´å£2.99).	unchanged
oppose					Mr Cook argued that 10 years of Thatcherism had been forced on most people, who had never voted Conservative, and that many of those who opposed PR in the Labour Party wanted to use the same undemocratic power to ram socialism down the throats of a majority who didn't vote for it.	The rhetoric of the Tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisations of colonial trauma, and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance.	unchanged
coordinate					As may be seen in Fig. 3.1 the coordinates of the wire element are x', y', z', whereas the coordinates of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field are set of coordinates.	Day care in each area would be organised and coordinated through the children's day centres which would also provide information, support and resources to parents.	unchanged
alienated					The imagery of the black bomber, used in Handsworth was extended to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw the riots as a chance to engage in an orgy of looting.	Hale's eyes stare knowingly at the viewer, a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture.	unchanged
inherit					Lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited Wyvis Hall and had walked in here and astounded them with his news.	There will be the reality of the economic situation which we inherit, which will not be our fault, but it will be our responsibility.	unchanged
float					Standing by the swimming pool at Saracen, Miranda beckoned to Adam, who was floating on the water in a transparent blow-up plastic armchair.	Oldham took up the attack again and Barlow, who had a fine match at left-back, totally containing Rocastle, floated in a deep cross beyond Winterburn.	unchanged
use					After Handsworth part of the press response was to blame the riot on rivalry between West Indians and Asians, and even after the arguments were criticized by local residents; and community leaders, they were used to explain' what happened.	Some peaks of demand can be dealt with by using consultants, but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation.	unchanged
reverse					On an impulse he reversed the Jaguar and drove quickly back to Martyr's Cottage.	The objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a resource consuming factor requiring regular payments, overheads in the form of heated, lighted, equipped workspaces and so on.	unchanged
derive					The infilling sandstone is derived from the fossil soil over which the root was growing.	The document, and the legislation that derived from it, pointed to a positively discriminatory approach : with both central and local government supplementing existing programmes in such a way as to strengthen local economies, as well as the physical and social environment.	unchanged

The feet of the sauropod are small (relatively speaking !), with short, stubby toes, yet animals that walk on soft mud tend to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly.	unchanged
design					Hobeika and Jamei (1985) describe the MASSeVACuation (MASSVAC) simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area.	It seemed strange to make that argument, Mr Cook said, when it was clear the whole policy review process was designed to placate the centre ground.	unchanged
arise					The monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network (RIMNET) and has, as its prime responsibility, the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the UK of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident.	While the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, it was the publication of Hayden Herrera's biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status.	unchanged

Finally, after the third month passed with no rent received, Debbie phoned the tenants, asked them to pay her directly, and sent Landlords a recorded-delivery letter, which was returned, and finally one by ordinary post stating that Landlords were no longer employed as the managing agents.	unchanged
exploit					Mooneyhan (1988) has described the progress of the pilot stage of GRID which culminated in approval for a full operational phase; GRID is now involved in integrating, storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases, mostly acquired from NASA.	Given the already appalling and growing rate of homelessness and lack of hostel facilities in London, when more people than ever will not only have to endure the freezing nights of the coming winter on the streets, but perhaps permanent homelessness, it was terrible to see the situation being exploited for a joke by your advertisement : Just the thing now the evenings are drawing in.	unchanged

perceive					But common sense may have been more important than learning in perceiving the vulnerability of most castles to battering-rams and catapults; for even in 1100 they were, as a rule, primitive structures.	Geoffrey Martel had perceived the propaganda potential of public war as early as the mid eleventh century; later it enabled Henry the Liberal of Champagne to claim the military service of all lords within his county, a reapplication of the Carolingian ban.	unchanged
stuck					Adam had Hilbert's old golf-bag stuck between his legs and Rufus guessed the gun was inside it.	In Four Saints Thomson's informality was given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then, when it stuck, wrote it down to a figured bass.	unchanged
impose					That proposal, if implemented, would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage : the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed, and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone.	If causing death is to be regarded as the most serious harm that can be inflicted, it would seem to follow that the most blameworthy form of homicide should result in the highest sentences imposed by the courts.	unchanged
serve					Hughey, you serve him !	In 1983 the Home Secretary imposed restrictions on the release of persons serving life for murders of police- and prison-officers, terrorist killings, murder during robbery, and the sadistic or sexual murder of young children, fixing a minimum of twenty years' imprisonment for these offenders.	unchanged

demonstrate					In these sections punishment will be understood to mean the infliction of pain and the review of the project will seek to demonstrate that the probation practice described is not only more demanding but also more effective than this traditional understanding of punishment.	A major, though often ignored, work by Kahlo demonstrates the cultural politics underlying her art.	unchanged
outline					He traced the contours of her face with gentle fingers, outlining the curve of her mouth, stroking her temples.	While the entire network of popular committees, local institutions and the general public constitute the field commanders in the battle of civilian disobedience and of constructing a political infrastructure, a rotating Unified National Command acts in the role of field-general, issuing a bi-monthly directive outlining policy and determining specific resistance programmes.	unchanged
clutch					Ahead of him, trudging along on the left of the path, was a little group of children, the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller children, one each side of her, clutching the bars.	 I said, dear, Winston Churchill  The second woman tugged free of the clutching fingers.	unchanged
arrange					This fossil bark is typified by its lozenge-shaped leaf scars arranged in spiral rows.	The selectors knew they were playing with fire when they decided to arrange a couple of club fixtures and they have duly been consumed in a conflagration of their own making.	unchanged
separate					Each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in Fig. 10.1 draws upon the classic work of Burton and Kates (1964) in separating geophysical from biological hazards and Zeigler et al. (1983) in distinguishing public (or what we might call societal) hazards from private (individual) ones.	Interwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate Latin American culture from that of Europe and North America.	unchanged
convey					The differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other hazard typologies.	As an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to his audience's reactions and so convey the impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousands.	unchanged
choose					Under pressure from Satra, Kirov told singers to choose between the companies.	For Kahlo, however, choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana, as for example in Tree of Hope (1946) (Fig. 8), was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity.	unchanged

Neither, at first, did the incoming administration foresee the impact of rising unemployment, which was to be especially serious among the urban young.	unchanged
shock					I was shocked for a minute.	But now she was visibly shocked by the drained and haggard-looking face which kissed her.	unchanged
act					The DoE, through Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP), was given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan, installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency (HMSO 1988).	It's not ethical as they are acting for the landlord, he says.	unchanged
close					Without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him, closed the front door after her without locking it and got into the car.	The trees had grown up beside it in the twenty-five years since the railway had closed, and the boy stopped every now and then to watch small birds hopping around the top branches.	unchanged
protect					Elinor sometimes thought of all the love and the hatred, the treachery and the killing that this hall had undoubtedly seen, when strong men fought hand-to-hand to the death, to protect their women and children.	Sometimes, too, houses have to be sold by auction to satisfy the legal requirements of trustees or executors (auctions provide adequate proof that the property has been sold at the going market value, and protect trustees from future claims of negligence).	unchanged
finance					Doctors are worried that women turning to prostitution to finance the habit are at risk of contracting Aids.	Another was the transformation of many such bodies, already heavily subsidized from public funds, into de facto agencies of the state, which financed them and indirectly determined their policy.	unchanged
deal					In reply Roy Hattersley supported the call for the immediate suppression of street violence, but warned that the roots of such riots could not be dealt with until all people felt they had a stake in British society (ibid. : cols. 1407åäÌÝÌÕ9)	The second time round they dealt with R. and B. Lettings in London NW10, who they instructed just to find a tenant.	unchanged
greet					Muldoon rose immediately from his enormous black leather chair to greet him, coming from behind the vast desk with hand outstretched.	Its vast walls of flint and glass and Gothic tracery were brilliantly floodlit and the churchyard cat, sleek and black as tar, greeted us querulously and led us right round the church and through the gravestones at the back, glimmering and pale in the moonlight.	unchanged
slump					To her relief, Elinor was not slumped on the floor; deathly white, she clung for support to the silver brocade hangings of her bed.	As they set up the now empty suit with its back to the door, half slumped over a control panel, he settled down behind the curtained entrance of the showers.	unchanged
risk					We should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends;	Risking the dismay of circuit engineers some theoreticians do, in fact, refer to eqn (3.35) as Ohm's law.	unchanged
minimize					There can be little doubt that a GIS approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize (rather than, as conventionally, maximize) accessibility to a population.	Conservative instincts were, of course, to minimize within the partnership state involvement and expenditure, relative to that of private enterprise.	unchanged
shake					Adam stopped and shook his head.	He had metaphorically shaken a large fist, impotently, at some looming energy-field, and got on with his work, his work.	unchanged
miss					They ought to have pocketed three points in the first half-hour but Tony Adams, a more threatening centre-forward on his forays than the current Alan Smith, missed the target with two headers and David Rocastle let Dave Beasant save a penalty, much as the stretch-version keeper had done for Wimbledon in the 1988 FA Cup final.	but think what you missed	unchanged
surround					A first time garden is usually small and certainly the typical one I am imagining for this series is no more than 40ft x 20ft and surrounded on all sides by other houses.	It is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed Kahlo's choice.	unchanged
participate					Responding to the Handsworth events Douglas Hurd was moved to argue forcibly that such events were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place : The sound which law abiding people in Handsworth heard on Monday night, the echoes of which I picked up on Tuesday, was not a cry for help but a cry for loot (Financial Times, 13 September 1985).	FISA was then a relatively unimportant body which organised European and other championships and participated in the running of Olympic regattas.	unchanged
determine					However, the Pope's account of the role of the papacy went a great deal farther than that : Christian unity, he said, must be founded on the faith in Christ that was handed on by the Apostles; what this faith is must be determined by the Roman Catholic Church.	Penny, sounding childishly, sullenly determined, broke into her mother's thoughts.	unchanged
confirm					Forster was sorely tempted to nip out and confirm that the noise was coming from George by twiddling the volume and tuner, but fought down the urge.	Broadly, the survey confirmed that parents of children with special needs had not been given a real choice of placement, and that they had to fight hard for mainstream provision if this was their choice.	unchanged
reveal					There is a poignant irony in the way clothing, which on one level served to hide Kahlo's broken body, falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique (Fig. 4).	The fascination with functions of the body, the analogies between artistic and physical creative processes, self-portraiture used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse; all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s.	unchanged
lose					Shah (1983) made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period 1974åäÌÝÌÕ80 and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude (measured in terms of lives lost) are increasing.	The colonised body which Kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism has lost its function as a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering.	unchanged
attain					After the next change in dynasty, Thierry and Philip of Alsace strengthened their shaky claim to the comital position by attaining for themselves the prestige attached to being the outstanding crusaders of their generation.	This specimen is 15 cm long, but roots have been found which attain a length of 14 metres !	unchanged
charge					On one long wall hung a row of Van Goghs, including an Arles " Poets' Garden " he hadn't seen before, but recognised, from small photographs, from charged descriptions in the painter's letters.	In Bristol and West's forthcoming auctions, a set fee of Ì´å£375 plus VAT will be charged to everyone entering property to sell, with its usual agent's commission (about 2 per cent plus VAT) charged on top when sales are made.	unchanged
achieve					The objectives of the new agency would be to assist the Community and the Member States to achieve the goals set out in the Treaty of Rome and in successive environmental action programmes; it must also, however, be seen in the context of the European Council's adoption on 2 December 1988 of the Rhodes Declaration on the Environment and the environment chapter in the Single European Act which comes into effect in 1992.	It plans to issue a protective writ but is hoping to achieve a settlement.	unchanged
address					As an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to his audience's reactions and so convey the impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousands.	But in their prepared homilies the Pope and the Archbishop addressed quite different problems.	unchanged
welcome					Equally, the signposting role now being adopted by UNEP's GRID project which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in 1991 is to be welcomed.	Sir : Despite a significant gap in the Labour Party's education and training proposals, their objective to double the number of 16-18year-olds in full-time education must be welcomed (28 September).	unchanged
trace					He traced the contours of her face with gentle fingers, outlining the curve of her mouth, stroking her temples.	Despite the contemporary tone of much of Action for Cities, the programme's heritage can be traced to the early 1960s studies which provided the basis for the 1965 MilneråäÌÝÌÕHolland Report on housing and the 1967 Plowden Report on education, as a result of which general improvement areas and education priority areas were established.	unchanged
leap					John House, who had organised the exhibition, came almost leaping down the stairs accompanied by a smallish woman in a pine-green tent-like coat.	She leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world.	unchanged
worried					If it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary, indeed is even vital, the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important : the 170 000 people in the Maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the islands is more than 2 m above present sea-level !	He wondered if Rufus had children and if so did he worry about them coming to terrible harm the way Adam worried ?	unchanged
hide					If Goodenache's frightened, and he wants to hide, that's as good a place as any.	It's all so ridiculous that we're not going to even think about it any more, she said firmly, hiding her fears.	unchanged
fear					Thierry's remote connection with the family of Godfrey de Bouillon, along with his marriage with Sybilla of Anjou, Fulk V's daughter, gave him some claim to the throne of Jerusalem; as a consequence, the aristocracy of Outremer viewed him and Philip with mixed feelings, expecting much of them, yet fearing their ambitions.	John of Salisbury's comment that not only the towns but also the fortresses of Gaul feared Henry I of England was revealing of the new situation.	unchanged
match					We shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former (see, for instance, Burton et al. 1978 and Perry 1981) has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter.	It was an excitement that matched my own, for I had never sailed the South Seas and I had long dreamed of that scatter of tiny, magically named islands strewn across one third of a globe.	unchanged
snatch					With a blood-curdling growl, the curtain was snatched aside.	Thirty five a snatch back or the repossession type thing I suppose.	unchanged
report					Thus, The Times of 17 December 1990 reported that a group of 40 of the most senior Civil Servants had met the previous weekend to discuss ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems such as the threat of global climate change.	The radio reported that the missing H-bomb had been located on the Atlantic seabed.	unchanged
investigate					He has not properly investigated the target's dining facilities.	In contrast to our previous example we shall now investigate a cylindrical beam consisting of two kinds of charge carriers : negative electrons and some positive particles, which I do not wish to be more precise about at the moment.	unchanged
damp					The garden for them should feel like an extra sitting room, gnat-ridden perhaps, damp occasionally, but an important overflow of living space.	They held their line and competed hard in midfield, damping down Oldham's initial verve and preparing themselves for more of the same in the second half.	unchanged
cry					Please don't ! she cried.	And now although her whole body cried out for fulfilment and she longed for Joss Barnet to complete what he had surely come to do, she knew that she must not let it happen.	unchanged
hop					Next morning Ruth was down in the kitchen early, eagerly hoping to find Sean there.	It plans to issue a protective writ but is hoping to achieve a settlement.	unchanged
subdued					But he had said nothing, only looked subdued, and Adam realized why.	Lewis's subdued air had changed to one of high good humour.	unchanged
rely					Technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare, so that it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk, especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency.	The general form relied on the argument that the riots were not a form of protest against the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police, but a criminal act or a cry for loot.	unchanged
question					This is a clear example of the extension of the Prevention of Terrorism Act where criteria for stopping, questioning and searching are purely subjective to the official involved.	But the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational, uncivilized, and criminal instincts.	unchanged
finish					Buying and they finished off	Could finish off the UK vehicle division, he said forlornly, and Don Peters, he added, shaking his head.	unchanged
refine					In giving the 1990 Robens Coal Science Lecture at the Royal Institution, Sir John Mason (a former Director of the Meteorological Office) urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises; as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans, etc., lower values of predicted changes are likely.	The mandatory penalty does indeed serve to mark out murder from other crimes, but whether the definition of murder is sufficiently refined to capture the worst killings, and only the worst killings, remains to be discussed below.	unchanged
fight					Inevitably, therefore, war on the grand scale as fought by princes bore little resemblance in practice to the feuds of lesser men.	They were challenging the pay now sue later principle at Lloyd's, which says names should pay cash calls first and fight them later.	unchanged
suppress					Forster suppressed a nervous giggle.	To name an object is to suppress three-quarters of the enjoyment of the poem, which is created by the gradual pleasure of apprehending it.	unchanged
operate					Training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for GRID staff.	The convex, middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated the appendages (which, as usual, are not preserved), and the relatively large volume of this region shows that the musculature was powerful.	unchanged
order					Oh, this will be of great help in ordering raw materials, but sometimes we get part deliveries, could we have an extra facility to deal with those ?	The moment the work was done he had ordered his coachman to drive him back to Millfield as fast as the horses would go.	unchanged
point					The analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors.	We're trying to smooth the path for purchasers, and streamline the system, says Graham Harrison, pointing out that live telephone bidding will also be available for those unable to attend.	unchanged
favour					Penelope, however, it had to be acknowledged, had made no attempt to rise above the blow she had been dealt by finding a dazzling girl of her own age favoured over herself in her uncle's will.	New Orleans favours a mid-morning milk punch, or its own variation on the gin fizz.	unchanged
measure					Shah (1983) made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period 1974åäÌÝÌÕ80 and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude (measured in terms of lives lost) are increasing.	The snippet in Rufus's Monday morning newspaper measured just an inch in depth.	unchanged
blow					Sweetman drew on his fancy cigarette, then blew a plume of smoke into Wavebreaker's rigging before smiling lazily at Ellen.	They blew away the chauffeur's head with a machine gun.	unchanged
slow					Instinctively he slowed down.	In parliament there would be a carefully organized campaign of resistance that would at least slow the government down and raise Unionist morale.	unchanged
inaugurate					Furthermore, the listing of Battersea had ensured the building's survival for conversion to a new use in that case, as an entertainment centre which the Prime Minister herself had praised and inaugurated.	The twelfth century was characterized, therefore, by fewer but more protracted wars, which smouldered for long periods between short, sharp bouts of conflict, like the war that covered must of the reigns of Henry I of England and Louis VI of France, the one inaugurated by the great rebellion of 1173, which outlived both Louis VII and Henry II, or that against Catalan claims in the south.	unchanged
slip					Mark slipped an arm around her slim waist as they walked from the hall into the kitchen.	Ah, fill the cup, what boots it to repeat, how time is slipping underneath our feet, he quoted with a sigh.	unchanged
originate					The Unionist recovery was built around Law's leadership, but what Asquith called the " new style " of obstruction, threats and offensive behaviour did not originate with Law.	The paradigm which is described originates from doctoral research into generic probation practice and has been presented in a book Adult Probation and Juvenile Supervision : Beyond the Care-Control Dilemma (1989, Gower).	unchanged
bring					The Commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a European scale, nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a Community-wide basis (a realization brought about through the CORINE programme described later).	His friendship with Raymond V of Toulouse, a fellow warrior, reversed the trend of history since the middle of the tenth century, in bringing the princes of the far south back into the king's mouvance.	unchanged

cross					Henry II's castle at Chinon, where the treasury of Anjou was situated, was the model for its generation, with its halls, upper chambers, tower, and curtain walling, set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the Loire.	Presumably the justification is that D has already crossed a high moral/social threshold in choosing to commit such a serious offence, and should therefore be held liable for whatever consequences ensue, however unforeseeable they may be.	unchanged

This article challenges the conceptual and practical appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to the probation context.	unchanged

It could be copied only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resources chiefly on defence princes, great bishops or, in the south especially, towns.	unchanged
regard					Some researchers suggest that hazards (and emergencies that might result) can be regarded as either natural or technological.	Its significance lies in its double message : that the aim of the Palestinian struggle is the establishment of Palestinian independence, and that this independence is regarded as being not at Israel's expense.	unchanged

push					So I asked him what he was up to and he said he was going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it, and then he pushed th " trolley in, and I went in after, and the mother began her howling and shrieking, and Will said, " Well, I'll walk off and leave you to it. "	Where such arguments did not fit in with the overarching themes of race, violence and disorder, and social deprivation they were either sidelined or pushed into the sub-clauses of official reports.	unchanged
construct					Whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies, developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances, or monitoring the health implications of a disaster, GIS can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions.	Through it, Palestinians are struggling on a daily basis to shake off Israel's authority and to construct their own.	unchanged

Even in crimes of violence which leave some permanent physical disfigurement or psychological effects, the victim retains his or her life and, therefore, the possibility of further pleasures and achievements, whereas death is final.	unchanged

decay					Now he steps out on beer-stained carpets and decaying floor-boards, but the conviction remains as strong.	A subsequent debate on the same issue in March 1982 was also full of references to the experience of 1981, the impact of street violence, crime, decaying urban conditions, the breakdown of consent between the police and many local communities, and the spectre of more violence to come if changes in both policing tactics and social policy were not swiftly introduced (Hansard, vol. 20, 25 March 1982 : cols. 1107åäÌÝÌÕ81).	unchanged

blame					Can the problems of urban poverty be blamed on individual pathology ?	The ambiguities and sub-clauses to be found in much of the press coverage during 1980åäÌÝÌÕ1 had at least acted as a countervailing tendency against the more extreme forms of discourse which blamed the riots completely on black people.	unchanged
die					If I die abroad in exile, let my body rest in a temporary grave until my mortal remains be transferred to our dear homeland, said the Montenegrin President, Branko Kostic, reading the royal will and testament to the crowds in Cetinje Square, who carried flags and portraits of Nicholas and his queen, Milena.	The storm was abating rapidly, the evening sky clearing in the west with the golden rays of the setting sun adding a dying colour to the sullen slate blue water.	unchanged
sever					He would have been lying if he had recorded only the more accessible drama of the painter's electric quarrels with Gauguin in the Yellow House in Arles, the distant necessary brother who supplied paint and love, the severed ear delivered to the whore in the brothel, the asylum fears.	First, a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign was begun by which people severed, or minimised, all the contact points by which they were bound to the Israeli occupation authority.	unchanged
tend					Some peaks of demand can be dealt with by using consultants, but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation.	The warm-blooded supporters tend to ally themselves with the supporters of a theory about the relationships of the dinosaurs.	unchanged
wipe					Mum I've wiped	He decided to wipe the smile off his face.	unchanged
base					One solution to this is to densify the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers rather than the traditional, spectrally based ones.	It would be unfair both to the vector potential and to quantum mechanics to say that none of those formulations have engineering applications (in fact the most sensitive magnetometer built to date is based on that kind of theory), but by and large engineers wouldn't lose much sleep if the use of A were banned with immediate effect.	unchanged

In low politics, common opinion no less common for being expensively hired by Conservative Central Office encouraged him in the belief that he should fight much of the election sitting down.	unchanged

They'll say they, they probably haven't got the finances to back up what they what they said they would do.	unchanged
dazzle					I had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and I could see Sweetman properly, and what I saw I did not like.	But she looked briefly down, dazzled by the flowing skin of worked and delicate colour; the blue and rose tourbillons of the mistral on the sea, the prismatically sliced frosty nimbus round the mysterious squat stacks.	unchanged
extend					Since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings, we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge (such as via tree rings, palynology, oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change);	Similarly, the assisting extends beyond simply providing handouts of useful information :	unchanged

encounter					No other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states.	This chapter is an account of the way they perceived attempts to develop integrated provision for under fives and the barriers in attitudes and systems which were encountered.	unchanged
spoil					So Lewis did not say, even to himself, when he was privately considering trying to get hold of his son in Tenerife, that he disliked Adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday.	If he had done the shock would have been less but on the other hand, his holiday would have been spoilt.	unchanged
study					The main reason is that though some problems are local and are best studied that way many others (even involving a limited geographical extent) are best understood within a global framework.	Like many young American composers he studied with Nadia Boulanger, but after 1925 set out to achieve the discipline of spontaneity which he found in Stein's writings.	unchanged
succeed					Again Law succeeded by unorthodoxy; he was quick to grasp the essentials of an opponent's argument and quite prepared to be rude or direct if the situation demanded it.	Contrast this with the position in jurisdictions where there are three or more degrees of homicide : pleas of guilty to first- and second-degree murders would be less frequent, since there would be the possibility of argument in court (if no bargain was struck beforehand between prosecution and defence), and the defence might succeed in persuading the jury to reduce the degree of the killing.	unchanged
repeat					I repeat that l do not believe that the principal cause of last week's riots was the conduct of the police.	There was a field of poppies and corn which reminded him only of small and large, faded and ghostly versions of Van Gogh's " Harvest " which he had seen repeated in endless hospital corridors, waiting rooms, school offices.	unchanged
conclude					Finally, it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed.	The article concludes with an affirmation of the disciplined but non-punitive character of current probation work and argues that, to successfully protect the public and reintegrate offenders into the community, the probation officer's employment of established social work knowledge, skills, and values is a strength not a weakness.	unchanged
revert					Bloody clashes would occur whenever armoured units raided these villages, storming through makeshift defensive road blocks and responding to rocks being thrown with live bullets and tear gas; but no sooner would these army units be gone than authority would revert to the village residents.	Apart from Kevin Moseley's steady supply from the line-out, there was nothing much to commend in a Welsh forward effort which reverted to the very worst Eighties stereotype of static, cumbersome donkeys only too willing to slow the game to walking pace.	unchanged

poise					Punishment is just a word after all : nothing more than convenient political rhetoric meriting only lip-service from probation managers and practitioners poised at the window of opportunity.	This small painting on metal, in the style of a Catholic votive image, shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist North America and the archaic fertility of Mexico.	unchanged
diminish					Although this is not in itself to be dismissed as a tactic, it has diminished the complexity of Kahlo's achievement as a specifically Mexican painter, operating within the particularities of her historical moment.	The odd policy to put the stage in the middle of the room rather than at one end leads to a diminishing of the atmosphere (the corners are seldom filled).	unchanged
answer					Although the raster displays are very crude it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people (for instance, particular age groups) within certain distances of toxic hazard sites.	It answered the question he had asked himself and told him that the bones of a very young child had been found as well as those of a young woman.	unchanged

care					You must be Nicholas Breakspear, he said carelessly, as though he did not much care whether I was or not.	Mrs Bottomley, representing caring Conservatism, will face Mr Michael Portillo, the new Treasury Chief Secretary, who is equally keen to establish his Right-wing credentials by demonstrating he can keep keep a tight grip on the public purse strings.	unchanged
stain					I found it hard to picture what kind of landscape those statistics might have shaped, until I opened the Ordnance Survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centre.	The inner city has been variously regarded as a cause for moral outrage, a threat to public order, or as a stain on the nation's conscience.	unchanged
school					I know, he went to school to do	She was no longer in the habit of being late : her life had schooled her to temporal accuracy, perhaps to being considerate.	unchanged
kill					The African drought put the lives of 35 million people at risk and may have killed 1 million of them;	In the air, that risk factor would kill you.	unchanged
confine					First we shall assume that the current density is confined to a thin wire in which case the integration variable may be changed to formula, where S is a vector normal to the cross-section, formula is the area of the cross-section, and dI is an elementary vector along the tangent of the wire.	As far as I know, my son's personal acquaintance with Wyvis Hall was confined to my uncle's lifetime when 1, my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him.	unchanged
mention					The room in which they were sitting underwent the curious shrinking process to which it was subject whenever he was reminded of Wyvis Hall or his Uncle Hilbert or even if the county of Suffolk were mentioned.	As mentioned earlier there are always the twin problems of how to get the information and how to present it.	unchanged
attempt					Frederica did not attempt to ascertain the fumbled name, having given up interest in stray new people until it was clear that they were of real concern.	One method attempts to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal with living analogues.	unchanged
labour					she's started Liam, they're having a pre-packed school at Durham choir boys, whatever it is, cos he's from school, apparently the locality of demanding six year olds and under so they and another labouring school	The boy and the dog skirted round opposite sides of the puddle, the boy, a light, tall fourteen-year-old, labouring in wellington boots too large for him, and the dog, a three-year-old Labrador bitch, picking her way reluctantly, with frequent pauses, as if her paws hurt.	unchanged
commit					Murder is committed in those situations where D caused death by an act or omission which he knew had death as the probable or highly probable result.	Yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially kings, whose competence to declare war could not be impugned : thus Thibaud of Blois failed to persuade the monks of Marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against Louis VI; they claimed discretion in the matter; and in 1184, the mighty Philip of Alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against Philip Augustus, through fear that its ranks might melt away.	unchanged
shrug					The Exec Director shrugged.	Yet given what we have learned about links between the security services and the Loyalist paramilitaries in Northern Ireland, and the deep suspicion about surrogate murders, you can't shrug off the shiver Conlon's words bring.	unchanged
register					In the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor's notes (Menary, 1986) by the explanation : This session aims to get participants to consider the subject of alcohol in ways they had not thought of in the past (p. 3).	He made no secret of his Francophile enthusiasms, in reaction to the earlier domination of American music by Germans, and he was one of the first writers to register the importance of jazz.	unchanged
couple					A third, more precise formulation derives from the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980, namely, that a killing should be classified as murder in those situations where there is an intention to cause serious injury coupled with awareness of the risk of death.	But her desire to provide a period of stability for nearly one million people employed by the NHS is coupled with a fierce determination to maintain the momentum of reform, with the overwhelming majority of hospitals becoming self-governing trusts by the mid-1990s.	unchanged
accept					We accept that we might not get very much for it, but on the other hand we could get more, says Julie Widlake.	It will be seen that English law does this up to a point, and in the process seems to accept social-defence arguments as reasons for departing from several of the principles set out in Chapter 3.	unchanged
foresee					Probably the most accurate statement would be that a person intends to kill if it is his or her purpose to kill by the act or omission charged, or if he or she foresees that death is practically certain to follow from that act or omission.	Neither, at first, did the incoming administration foresee the impact of rising unemployment, which was to be especially serious among the urban young.	unchanged
adapt					Identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable;	The problem arises in connection with section 99 which adapts or applies the provisions to cases where an individual rather than the local authority wishes to make the complaint.	unchanged
rush					Nine hundred years earlier, the great hall had been the hub of castle life : wolfhounds ate on floors strewn with rushes; servants slept on straw pallets thrown on the floor.	You might expect them to rush to La Mama's aid.	unchanged
regret					It wasn't the answer that the DDI expected and Sorge regretted his words.	Nor was it clear that Balfour's departure was universally desired : at the National Union Conference a few days later, Leo Maxse was booed off the platform, and constituency parties everywhere passed resolutions regretting Balfour's decision.	unchanged
assimilate					Peregrine Worsthorne, for example, used the ferocity of the confrontations in Handsworth, Brixton, and Tottenham to argue that there was a major question mark over the possibility of assimilating the coloured population into mainstream British values (Sunday Telegraph, 29 September 1985).	If punishment is assimilated into the probation glossary it will inevitably influence the sort of practice the Service undertakes.	unchanged
rest					The small light beneath the receiver rests showed that the line was working.	Another rule of thumb is that if the act is obliged to rest their microphone stand and amplifiers on beer crates instead of the stage, it will be a good evening.	unchanged
combine					When combined with the other facilities in ARC/INFO, quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled.	The picture was signed " Madeleine Bernard ", and Alexander told Frederica that Gauguin had flirted seriously with that young woman, had characterised her, as was fashionable at the time, as having the desirable, unattainable androgynous perfection, complete sensuality combined with unattainable self-sufficiency.	unchanged
cheer					He told Daniel about the terrible St RÌÎå©my painting of the blasted tree, about noir-rouge, and Daniel said that it was odd that these orchards should be all over the walls of other asylums now, to cheer people up.	Clare felt cheered to be back among like-minded people, doing something worth while.	unchanged
afford					The problem is that normally potential purchasers have to incur the expense of undertaking surveys and arranging mortgage finance, without any idea whether they will be able to afford the final selling price.	Mr Smith's warning coincided with a call by Ken Livingstone, the Labour MP for Brent East, who said on London Weekend Television's The Walden Interview : You can be miles ahead in the polls, but when you get to the last three weeks, people think, Can I afford a Labour government ?	unchanged
offer					For example, Field End House had been open for three years as a specialist unit for children with learning difficulties, and was designed to offer respite round the clock care.	They offered opportunities for men of skill to acquire great position in the world Arnoul of Ardres caught the eye of Countess Ida of Boulogne through his exploits; and they also conferred lustre on the great Geoffrey le Bel and Philip of Alsace were throughout France for their distinguished performances in these show battles.	unchanged
acquire					Mooneyhan (1988) has described the progress of the pilot stage of GRID which culminated in approval for a full operational phase; GRID is now involved in integrating, storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases, mostly acquired from NASA.	Task analysis has not and can not be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course.	unchanged
hamper					Digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision.	But their work is hampered by lack of money.	unchanged
gaze					His gaze came back to George, still sprawled over the control desk.	He saw a leg, uncomfortably wedged between sapling trees, swollen grotesquely, and gazed at it, stupidly, wondering if it was plastic.	unchanged
announce					It won't be announced for a week or so, but he's already been told.	Sir David English was not informed of the visit and in consequence had no plans to attend the Ideal Home Exhibition that day, the official statement announced.	unchanged
dare					I dare say O'Farrell will be back tomorrow before we leave.	This desire that can not find its name (though it would dare speak it, if it could) is pleasurable.	unchanged
cut					Delaney pulled the curtain across, covering Forster who cut a small slit in the opaque green plastic, widening it to give himself a better field of view.	Its continued presence always surprised him since it served no purpose that he could see except symbolically to cut off the headland and to give travellers pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue.	unchanged
proceed					Pearce et al. (1989) have argued that the effects of government, commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost/benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the UK government will proceed.	With an auction, you've got to be certain that at least two buyers are there who can commit themselves, and the difficulty is that buyers who can proceed are few and far between, said David Phillip, a director of Yorkshire estate agents Dacre Son and Hartley.	unchanged
double					Sir : Despite a significant gap in the Labour Party's education and training proposals, their objective to double the number of 16-18year-olds in full-time education must be welcomed (28 September).	Expenditure on Central Office, district offices and the London office doubled from Ì´å£32,466 in 1909åäÌÝÌÕ10 to $68,957 in 1913åäÌÝÌÕ14; the total expenditure of the party organization from central funds also doubled from $73,000 to over Ì´å£150,000.	unchanged
curl					Andy Barton, founder and chief executive of Barton Textiles, was almost as broad as he was long, virtually neckless, with incongruously long brown hair curling over his collar.	Thus the curl operates on the coordinates of P but not on those of dl leading to formula where ir is the unit vector in the direction r and we have made use of the vector relation (A3) in the Appendix.	unchanged
encourage					After they reached two thousand feet, the instructor showed her how to fly level; he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick, manoeuvring the plane m every direction.	Post-war reconstruction and housing programmes seemed to do nothing to prevent, and seemed even to encourage, a rise in crime and mental illness.	unchanged
detect					Although the proposed method is novel, it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model clusters of disease (see, for example, Cuzick and Edwards 1990).	Dolphins swimming near the barrier altered their behaviour to avoid it, the result, the scientists believe, of them detecting sonar echoes from the reflectors.	unchanged
speed					Auctions certainly speed up the house-buying process.	I'm up to speed with Huerter, of course, but is your planning application in Leicester all right ?	unchanged
refer					Adam always referred to my lawns, my house, my furniture.	Three elements refer to the female presence, all of them dealing with an essential lack.	unchanged
post					If she wants to go on the mailing list, just cut that bit off and fill that in and post it on to us.	HARDANGER, the retail property developer, posted pre-tax profits up Ì´å£1.3million to Ì´å£8.37million.	unchanged
pronounce					The divergence was sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction, the fruit of Augustinian theology, amplified as the century went on by canon and Roman law reference; princes pronounced their campaigns just wars (fought against aggressors with the aim of re-establishing peace) or public wars (declared by a competent authority in the public interest), while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace.	The year and a day rule is a legacy of times when medical science was so rudimentary that, if there was a substantial lapse of time between injury and death, it was unsafe to pronounce on whether the defendant's conduct or some other event caused the death.	unchanged
teach					Almost certainly the eldest child Theresa, wasn't it ? had been taught not to accept lifts from strangers, particularly men, and he was virtually a stranger.	Amaldi dodged the American invitation, perhaps because (with Rome liberated) Fermi's mantle in physics had fallen on his young shoulders and there were younger minds to teach.	unchanged
focus					This is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the ESSC (see above) and anticipating somewhat those of IGBP.	Such language focused attention on the individuals or groups who were breaking the law, committing criminal acts, and threatening the interests of the law-abiding majority.	unchanged
stick					You need a secure situation with someone you can trust, who you know will stick around because he loves you.	Can we just stick to what we're here to discuss ?	unchanged
interpret					This means in practice that district medical officers are charged with preparing an annual report, presenting and interpreting epidemiological data, identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes.	From the optical properties of this mineral we know that the lens was able to interpret light coming from a direction more or less at right-angles to the lens surface.	unchanged
explain					Second, just as Dear's image of a few hundred young black criminals was used to explain what happened in Handsworth, the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level.	The NAACP denounces The Silence of the Lambs because Hannibal the Cannibal shares his name with an African general, and the killer is Buffalo Bill (yes, that's a white man's nickname, but the buffalo, NAACP explain patiently, is associated with Native Americans).	unchanged
support					He was very nearly as tall as her, but she put an arm under his shoulders and supported him to the untidy room which served as the stable office, calling to one of the stable girls to take over the class.	Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup.	unchanged
accompany					When it did not, accompanying their princes in a joint crusading venture, as the lord of Amboise accompanied Fulk V or Hugh VI de Lusignan William IX, created new personal links.	Some of the refugees originally refused to touch East German territory again, but were reassured when two of the West German diplomats said they would accompany the train, to ensure that the rules were followed.	unchanged
fly					After they reached two thousand feet, the instructor showed her how to fly level; he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick, manoeuvring the plane m every direction.	The trees stood under their haloes of pink and green strokes, small flying things, solidified light movements or saccades of the eye, brushstrokes, pigment.	unchanged
mount					The result would be that killings were classified and labelled in a more refined way, but at the cost of lengthy trials and mounting legal-aid bills.	The 63-year-old head of Pembridge Investments, through which the bid is being mounted says, rule number one in this business is : the more luxurious the luncheon rooms at headquarters, the more inefficient the business.	unchanged
wash					If you like hanging out washing rather than drying it in the bowels of an expensive machine, you will need to tuck away a line and make a dry path to get to and from it.	Sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes, as it were, in this naked way, so that his earlier thoughts of this garden had to be undone, the idea of black wings to be stripped from the painted leafage, the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed off the notation of geraniums.	unchanged
surprised					Surprised Kevin wants to, surprised Kevin wants to go.	Its continued presence always surprised him since it served no purpose that he could see except symbolically to cut off the headland and to give travellers pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue.	unchanged
urge					In giving the 1990 Robens Coal Science Lecture at the Royal Institution, Sir John Mason (a former Director of the Meteorological Office) urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises; as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans, etc., lower values of predicted changes are likely.	He was also carrying an orange poster on a pole, urging a vote for the local Liberal Democrat candidate.	unchanged
shift					Lawton had already shifted some chairs, in readiness to form a barricade.	That proposal, if implemented, would shift almost all the decision-making in homicide cases from the trial to the sentencing stage : the only issue of any consequence in most cases would be the sentence to be imposed, and all the distinctions now drawn at the stage of criminal liability would be reflected in the sentence alone.	unchanged
descended					Nuns ascended and descended a cool grey stair in winged white caps.	Descended from an Aztec mother goddess, Llorona is a long-suffering mother figure, symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the Spanish invasion.	unchanged
train					We trained on an artificial pitch for two days this week and we should have done a lot better.	P. Taylor has noted that Law was trained, if he was trained for anything in his early career, to be a debater.	unchanged
distinguish					If the point of distinguishing murder from manslaughter is to mark out the most heinous group of killings for the extra stigma of a murder conviction, it can be argued that the grievous bodily harm rule draws the line too low.	English law distinguishes between the offences of murder and manslaughter, as we shall see, but the two crimes do have certain common elements.	unchanged
damage					the erm that good place that sells secondhand er or damaged erm	Armstrong seems the least permanently damaged on the surface.	unchanged
administer					It does not imply political supremacy, and does not suggest that the Pope should administer the affairs of the Church of England, he said.	The 1970s Urban Programme had a social, rather than economic, emphasis and was administered by the Home Office.	unchanged
employ					So in the supply of information to newspapers predisposed to support the party, much was achieved merely by employing a specialist.	Harsh measures putting an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous lengthy period of time, demolishing homes, uprooting olive or citrus trees, physical intimidation and terror tactics employed by raiding army units, shooting, killing, cutting off water or electricity supplies and telephone links to villages or towns, mass arrests, intimidatory interrogation techniques can either create a temporary lull or activate an eruption.	unchanged
cater					The Beacon had been in existence for many years and in the past had catered for up to thirty children with a wide range of disabilities and needs.	To cater for all susceptibilities, the party became the " National Unionist Association of Conservative and Unionist Associations " a decision that allowed some local parties to go on calling themselves Conservative, but the name " Liberal " was at last dropped.	unchanged
highlight					In this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them.	Furthermore, it highlights the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice.	unchanged
break					I broke the lock and took it back to the shop in La Jolla.	Since 1986 Rytasha has broken awayfrom her guru and set up on her own with a charity called Food Relief International, which raises money from the fiercely competitive matrons of Palm Beach and distributes it to the starving people of Bangladesh.	unchanged
inhabit					The yellow chair, besides being brushstrokes and pigment, besides being a yellow chair, was one of twelve bought for a company of artists who were to inhabit the Yellow House, the white walls of which should blaze with sunflowers as the windows of Gothic cathedrals blazed with coloured light.	In Kahlo's painting, the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street, literally coming down to earth.	unchanged
centre					It is important that participants are provided with the skills to reduce their drinking levels or handle more effectively pub centred problems.	Any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets.	unchanged
solve					Mrs Thatcher, a recent convert to environmental conservation, clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective :	Evidence began to mount that much of the social welfare paternalism of the post-war period had created almost as many problems as it solved.	unchanged
cast					Or had his horse gone lame, cast a shoe ?	His warning casts doubt on Labour's commitment to increase spending on priority programmes for the health service and pensions.	unchanged
pointed					Wordlessly, she pointed above the fireplace.	The document, and the legislation that derived from it, pointed to a positively discriminatory approach : with both central and local government supplementing existing programmes in such a way as to strengthen local economies, as well as the physical and social environment.	unchanged
shoot					In July 1890, two years after writing this, Van Gogh had shot himself inefficiently in the groin, and had died slowly.	The police driver shot Jamie a look of enquiry which he missed, occupied as he was with guiding Miss Williams back up the hill.	unchanged
conceive					This is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the ESSC (see above) and anticipating somewhat those of IGBP.	It will be a further challenge to Israel's occupation, conceived in the image of earlier challenges of the Intifada.	unchanged
hurt					I won't hurt you, he said.	It wouldn't have hurt her to say she was sorry.	unchanged
link					As a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by Cross (1989) on childhood leukaemia.	The importance of this debate can be explained, partly, by the political capital which the Opposition could make from linking the social and economic malaise of the country at large with violent street disturbances.	unchanged
strip					Jean was in that horrible mustard and black striped	Sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes, as it were, in this naked way, so that his earlier thoughts of this garden had to be undone, the idea of black wings to be stripped from the painted leafage, the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed off the notation of geraniums.	unchanged
settle					Forster settled down, only putting his eye to the slit every half minute, not continually as he had started to do.	After they'd gone, Forster felt the silence physically settle around him.	unchanged
import					If he wants to import vehicles or components from Taiwan or Singapore or Hong Kong into Europe, he'll go ahead and do it, regardless of the economic consequences for the European countries concerned.	Some say it was the importing of whole streets of fighting families from the fishquays, with their dockland diversions of prostitution, drug-dealing and handling.	unchanged
prop					She pointed to the figure of a man propped in the corner, and the cylinders of oxygen in the back pack lying beside it.	Fortunately, Leinster's front five, which includes the experienced tight-head prop Des Fitzgerald, looks upto the task of scrummaging against the All Blacks.	unchanged
lag					Well it's good good, got a well lagged tank.	Britain is lagging behind.	unchanged
emphasize					These two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area.	The White Paper goes on to emphasize : It is the loss of liberty involved in carrying out the terms of the order rather than the activities carried out during the order which is the punishment (p. 18, para. 4.4).	unchanged
head					By the time he had rallied and got himself together and was thinking of things to say to the police it was too late and they were heading north.	Here's us, heading for trouble and God knows what else, and in the middle of you talking about Nordhausen, I start thinking of Peter.	unchanged
re					He also kissed Frederica and introduced the woman, fumbling her name, as " a colleague " and Frederica as " Frederica you must forgive me, I never know what name you re working under, women these days are so protean. "	Yet it consolidated the king's position within France, partly through the skilled regency of Suger, but also because, in taking on himself the leadership of the expedition, Louis re-emerged as a credible ruler of men.	unchanged
conduct					A major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using GIS to monitor this (Merchant et al. 1987; Barringer et al. 1987; von Braun 1988).	Mrs Bottomley's first big test as Health Secretary will come this summer with the annual public spending round, which will be conducted against a background of concern over high Government borrowing and pressure from the Tory Right for public spending cuts.	unchanged
remove					You can remove ?	This appropriateness of Kahlo's aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context, to stress the collective and the cross-cultural.	unchanged
retire					Retired	But Amaldi never really retired nor grew old.	unchanged
delay					Others, such as a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas, may persist for a week or more, have delayed consequences, may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations.	Wales, characteristically, delayed the heel at a scrum, putting Robert Jones in trouble when the ball finally emerged.	unchanged
occupy					Certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it on either a temporary or permanent basis.	Since many kinds of trilobites co-existed at any one time they were probably occupying different ecological niches, behaving in different ways, corresponding with the wide variation in shape that they show.	unchanged
dig					They've dug up	Ellen ignored my advice while I, obedient to the rule that if a job needed doing then do it without delay, found a pot of white paint and dug through the locker for a clean brush.	unchanged
free					Theresa gave him a brief, pitying smile, dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while, with the other hand, she collapsed the pushchair, with a single vigorous shake.	Had not his grandson Raymond V fulfilled his crusading obligation in his early youth, thereby freeing himself from the necessity of interrupting his career in the county, the principality of Toulouse might have disintegrated altogether.	unchanged
recognise					On one long wall hung a row of Van Goghs, including an Arles " Poets' Garden " he hadn't seen before, but recognised, from small photographs, from charged descriptions in the painter's letters.	They recognise, however, that the women in their study were largely middle-class, who might well have sufficiently large zinc stores because they were well nourished.	unchanged
warrant					If one person chooses to cause serious injury to another, it should be presumed that he or she realizes that there is always a risk of death, and such cases show a sufficiently wanton disregard for life as to warrant the label murder if death results.	Manuals which may contain maps, schematic diagrams and other materials warrant separate consideration.	unchanged
transform					Since remote sensing data sets (especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate, transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful (e.g. land cover) data, the processing power required is going to be formidable.	This non-punitive paradigm will provide a framework for contrasting the efficacy of current practice with future plans inappropriately to transform probation work into a new approach to punishment in the community (p. 18, para. 4.3).	unchanged
engage					The masses are being engaged in the craft of state-masonry.	The imagery of the black bomber, used in Handsworth was extended to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw the riots as a chance to engage in an orgy of looting.	unchanged
bit					If she wants to go on the mailing list, just cut that bit off and fill that in and post it on to us.	The difficulty is that Perry does everything that bit better than Tristram.	unchanged
worry					 Not to worry,  said Daniel.	Yeah haven't got to worry.	unchanged
stress					It should be stressed, however, that while the outlines of human activities are clear there are still many uncertainties : for instance, we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about 9 per cent since 1959.	In a statement afterwards Dr Runcie stressed that he was not proposing any change in the British constitution.	unchanged
worn					Alexander, always a connoisseur of garments, realised that Frederica had changed her style, that the clothes the young creatures were wearing could be described as a parody of the clothes Frederica had worn at their age, and that Frederica's new style was not unrelated to this shift.	Oh right yeah well I was so worn out	unchanged
summon					Yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially kings, whose competence to declare war could not be impugned : thus Thibaud of Blois failed to persuade the monks of Marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against Louis VI; they claimed discretion in the matter; and in 1184, the mighty Philip of Alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against Philip Augustus, through fear that its ranks might melt away.	But it will also be a challenge to us, Palestinians, summoning us to work more energetically towards the idea's fulfilment.	unchanged
underlie					Underlying it all, however, is one obvious fact : that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth.	Too much specialisation is bad for systems development; it feeds the temptation to get engrossed in technical difficulties and forget about the underlying business needs.	unchanged
deserve					He could have blamed this and that but he said we deserved it.	I wrote back asking the reasons for this, pointing out that, if any large modern power station deserved to be listed, it was Bankside.	unchanged

He reckons there are no shortages of possible uses farmers can use it to do their accounts, women with child-care responsibilities can work in their own time on the word processors, publicity material for local craftsmen can be produced and so on.	unchanged

touch					After being given clearance to land, Miranda, following her instructor's directions, started her approach; she throttled back to reduce speed and control her descent as she flew towards the threshold the point just before she intended to touch down.	In parliament he was wont to abandon an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point had been made; the speeches that appear in Hansard were touched up by his staff, and his speeches in the country were given to the press in advance.	unchanged
scrap					It's scraped back to bare metal !	In 1964 the All Blacks defeated Leinster 11-5, they won 17-8 in 1972 and scraped home 8-3 in 1974.	unchanged
clarify					The initial one-to-one meeting, held with one of the two group leaders, serves to clarify what participants can expect from the course and what is expected of them.	It's in your interests to clarify the situation.	unchanged
aim					Research at the North West Regional Research Laboratory (NWRRL) aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the Cancer Registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer.	In the first group session the counselling method is registered in the course tutor's notes (Menary, 1986) by the explanation : This session aims to get participants to consider the subject of alcohol in ways they had not thought of in the past (p. 3).	unchanged
sail					We decided that Masquerade would sail from the Bahamas to Panama, and thence to the Galapagos where we would find Darwin's giant tortoises.	He said : I had wondered whether a piece so drenched in Anglican chant (running from Gilbert and Sullivan to Morning Prayer and back) could rise and sail.	unchanged
got					Got the heater yeah yeah.	Got his use	unchanged
tie					His long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon, his skin was parchment pale, and his eyes dark.	I feel like a Maharajah waiting for the tiger to pounce on the tied-up goat, Forster grinned.	unchanged

reinterpret					We may, in fact, reinterpret any of the diagrams of Figs (2.25) -(2.31) by assuming that the whole space is filled with a material of conductivity formula] and the field lines are now the lines of current flow as well.	The western is being revived, reinterpreted for the 1990s.	unchanged
experienced					The Scarman Report, for example, located part of the explanation for the riots in the feelings of alienation and powerlessness which were experienced by young blacks living in depressed inner-city areas.	CRYSTALATE, the electronics product group, experienced a serious disappointment in the second half and hence profits fell from Ì´å£5.6million to Ì´å£2.9million in the year to September.	unchanged
introduce					This did not, however, stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised at all, as can be seen subsequently by the attempts after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally measures which were meant to address some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur.	A new canvass system was introduced in 1911 so that all county constituencies would operate the same system and so that duplicate records could be kept at area level.	unchanged
frame					Allan Ahlberg says : In the past, a lot of children's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant framed in a gallery, but when you tried to read the book, there was nothing there, because the words started as a coat-hanger to hang pictures on.	A second approach is to frame the law in such a way as to make it clear that the court should make a moral judgment on the gravity of the defendant's conduct.	unchanged
intersperse					In the churchyard in his last parish a family in the English 1870s had tried to name a son Walter Cornelius Brittain and had buried three, aged five, aged two, aged one month, interspersed by variegated dead daughters, a Jennet, a Marian, an Eva.	The rest of lunch passed in similar diversion, interspersed with details of last week's turnover which were never far from Barton's mind, whatever other distractions offered.	unchanged
award					Costs were awarded to the members' agents but not to Lloyd's.	His score for the film Louisiana Story was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1948.	unchanged
concede					He conceded that there would be disputes with colleagues, but said : There are no quick fixes, and I will not be indulging in any quick fix.	You've done very well, she conceded.	unchanged
expand					The analogy is found in such ocean-going amphipods (a kind of shrimp) as Cystosoma, which also has enormously expanded eyes, looking like headlamps, compared with its bottom-dwelling relatives (see above).	But they might have to be supplemented by mercenaries from Flanders and the Low Countries, where the rapidly expanding population forced large numbers of young men into military careers.	unchanged
relax					Then you'll relax and it'll happen then you'll stop being one of them miserable nymphos who hop from man to man, hoping for Mr Right, the man who can satisfy her.	and it does mean that they can relax you know about work and everything	unchanged
spread					In seconds, poor old George would be spread around the room like an explosion in Harrod's window, and the thing would be away.	He sat down and saw a bifurcated path, simmering with gold heat round and under the rising, spreading blue-black-green down-pointing vanes of a great pine, still widening where the frame interrupted its soaring.	unchanged
punish					I remember him saying it was a shame that he had to punish us both when only one of us was being naughty.	The poem highlights two important twelfth-century developments : the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime (the fruit of princely peace-keeping), and the increasing significance of siege-engines in warfare.	unchanged
overcome					Bristol and West hopes that by arranging collective auctions it will be able to overcome this problem.	Henning Albrechsten says : Modern information technology has given people in remote regions the opportunity to overcome their worst handicap; their distance from the centres of learning and development.	unchanged
sustain					On the other hand it can be argued that the sauropods like Brachiosaurus were so large, and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume, that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller, living reptiles.	But they will take into account the need for that balance that says that social spending without underpinning by economic growth will not be sustained in any event.	unchanged
enter					The area had effectively been abandoned by the authorities, a fact which became clear during the riot itself, when police waited five hours to enter the estate and put down the disturbances.	Walking here, you leave the 20th century behind on the outskirts of the forest and enter the reconstructed emptiness in which the reivers and cross-border raiders of the past could operate unhindered.	unchanged
supply					It was the Lucy Ghosts who supplied him with the cash that helped him build his empire.	The treaty between Robert II of Flanders and Henry I of England, renewed by their successors, stipulated that each knight supplied to the English king should bring three horses with him this at a time when a horse represented a major investment.	unchanged
calculate					In well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length of in-house experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirements.	The political spin-offs from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate than at first glance they might appear.	unchanged
communicate					Thing is don't you find in in this sort of environment if you've got, you know if they're nice people you all communicate don't you ?	His own terrible fear and anger had communicated itself to his father and shown him what the better part of valour was : keeping silent.	unchanged
wince					We used to watch the game together and I'd suddenly see him wince in pain.	Peter Yeo winced inwardly, but he was not going to tell Andy Barton that Angela was missing, or express any of his reservations about how much influence Angela could bring to bear.	unchanged
stare					Frederica dipped round her to stare : Claude Monet : " Au Cap d'Antibes par vent de mistral ".	Hale's eyes stare knowingly at the viewer, a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture.	unchanged
count					We may want to count numbers living within plumes, circles of fixed radius, buffer zones and so on.	You must be on time lateness will count as an absence.	unchanged
store					Their riches were stored in the banks under private accounts and then they were brought through Czechoslovakia and East Germany into the Soviet Union.	The passages it cancelled had, in any case, as in certain programmes, not been lost but stored on some limbo disc from whence they must now be retrieved.	unchanged
invent					In fact Meadowell is an Elastoplast name like Sizewell, invented in the 1970s to disguise what was already a running sore.	Come on don't invent you know ?	unchanged
reflect					She was in the swivel chair, reflected in the window with the dark night as a backdrop, her head angled towards him.	The material on which the information is printed, the typeface used, the sequence, the structure and the format generally should reflect the conditions of use, (Easterby and Zwaga, 1984).	unchanged
adopt					It is more useful (Johnson 1983) to adopt a non-partitional scheme (fig. 10.1) that recognizes, for instance, food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard, or lead pollution (e.g. from car exhausts) as both a meteorological event and technological hazard (both public and private).	A fourth approach, adopted by English law until 1957 and still in force in many American jurisdictions, is some form of felony-murder rule : anyone who kills during the course of a felony (or, more restrictively, a serious crime of violence) or whilst resisting arrest should be convicted of murder.	unchanged
arouse					When she wakened it was still dark, the orchestra still playing, though it was not that which had aroused her.	They have also aroused Protestant anger against Dr Runcie, at the same time as he has become involved in a row over his attack on the Pharisees of British society.	unchanged
attach					The leaflets are attached to the axis along their entire base.	There are important differences between the chapters in this part both in the nature of the demands that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and decision-makers in these fields.	unchanged
specify					Instead of persuading the user to specify requirements, the analyst will be driven by the user to meet key needs.	The magnetic field may be obtained from AmpÌÎåÂre's law (eqn (3.21)) as follows formula, where the line integral is taken over the circle of radius a (Fig. 3.2), I is the total current of the beam and formula is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the cylindrical coordinate system specified by formula].	unchanged
parallel					This kind of link between GIS and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the NWRRL in linking GIS and air pollution plume models.	Is it, we wonder, possible to contemplate bringing together some of these data sources to form a National Online Health Information System (NOHIS), to parallel that for employment and unemployment (Townsend et al. 1987) ?	unchanged
traipse					So, so so I said well we'll go to the N E C or she said oh I'm not traipsing all that way, you know, just for the concert.	Oh certainly not I'm staying at or the I am not traipsing across France.	unchanged
browse					If the dinosaur did, after all, live on dry land, then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow the animal to browse the high foliage of trees (see p. 116).	And we can browse and	unchanged
ratify					Don't ratify any names.	So within a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues, Law's leadership was ratified by the throng of party notables at Leeds; here he received a reception more typical of what was to come in the future.	unchanged
flow					She climbed the stairs to her room, then undressed and went to bed, wetting the pillow with her tears which, held back all day, now flowed unchecked.	He sees them as not only strengthening small communities, but also as actually beginning to reverse the population flows from the countryside to the towns.	unchanged
fill					In Mr Dobbs's words, a telecottage is a room in a village filled with computer communications that can be used by local people to learn and work.	I was also half drunk, and thus filled with the Dutch courage offered by Mama Sipcott's worst white wine.	unchanged
bang					But I mean they were banging they were banging fifteen hundred in for that disco for the first	But I mean they were banging they were banging fifteen hundred in for that disco for the first	unchanged
present					Pearce (1990), for instance, presented an economist's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows :	But it was the spirit of Henley, with huge crowds enjoying amateur sport, presented with administrative finesse, which Keller took as the yardstick for the international circuit.	unchanged
integrate					Workers from the integrated playscheme subsequently supported a local special school in integrating under fives into a playgroup.	Well, one can use eqn (3.1) as it is, but very often one is better off by using its integral form that can be obtained by integrating both sides of eqn (3.1) over a surface formula.	unchanged
articulate					But again it was Conlon, the slightly wild-eyed Irish poet of the quartet, articulate, flamboyant remember that extraordinary exit through the front door of the Old Bailey who cut deep into the collective conscience.	His strategy was rather to canalize the enthusiasm of the diehards into party channels, to articulate their views, and to create unity from the sense of movement.	unchanged
exhibit					In essence, they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework.	Well, I seem to recall a London gallery exhibiting a pile of rubbish, which was considered valid art by the proprietors and drew a large attendance.	unchanged
absorb					Moreover, recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the North Atlantic (every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather) is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical Pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the Drake Passage and up into the Atlantic.	The others were eventually released and absorbed into the Democratic Republic.	unchanged
replace					But, when asked in 1947 to replace an old dirty power station that had been on the site since 1891, he soon forgot such idealism and, like any architect, was glad to have the job.	The abstract talk of commuting by rail or road being replaced by information technology finds a concrete expression in the idea of telecottages.	unchanged
jump					Before jumping from the window of her apartment, Hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress, the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer.	Dixons' shares jumped to 153p in early trading but ended the day at 141p, a 22p rise.	unchanged
bet					Bet your popular with Nanny !	I bet she would, she loves anything like that !	unchanged
ride					At the opening party, an excited three-and-a-half-year-old Josh rode the pretty antique red rocking horse in the shop window.	What was surely the last ever Montenegrin royal event was masterminded by the republic's new Communist leadership, which has abruptly stopped describing Nicholas as a class enemy, to ride the same wave of popular patriotism and royal fervour which swept Serbia in the recent celebrations of the 600th anniversary of the battle of Kosovo.	unchanged
display					In this system, the solution to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network, which is displayed on the computer screen.	It was within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished, that young men learned to identify, their vassalage towards their lord as a symbol of their honour, that they debated the relative merits of Roland's and Oliver's way of displaying loyalty; and that they learned the finer points of jousting.	unchanged
control					Carefully designed case-control studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors.	After being given clearance to land, Miranda, following her instructor's directions, started her approach; she throttled back to reduce speed and control her descent as she flew towards the threshold the point just before she intended to touch down.	unchanged
manufacture					Zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods, those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers.	This assumes that nature only manufactures efficient designs.	unchanged
isolate					He stared at the serenely impassioned garden made out of a whirl of yellow brushstrokes, a viridian impasto, a dense mass of furiously feathered lines of blue-green, isolated black pot hooks, the painfully clear orange-red spattering.	Their respective positions explain this in part : as ex-Prime Minister and a considerable figure in his own right, Balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party; as the tertium quid in the recent contest, Law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view.	unchanged
respond					In a takeover campaign that has already seen vitriolic language, he responds to the charge that he is mounting the bid to enrich himself and his friends by saying : Nobody could take that as a criticism this is an investor group.	When Raymond of Toulouse, Robert II of Flanders, Robert Curthose, Stephen of Blois, and Hugh of Vermandois responded to the call, past and present members of their military households fell almost automatically into rank behind them, to test themselves against terrible dangers, but also to enjoy the companionship in arms, the adventure, the deeds of daring which were the stuff of the chansons de geste.	unchanged
whip					Ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped, praying every moment that Joss Barnet would return before they left Millfield next day.	One of these whipped back at him and as he caught at it a thorn drove into the fleshy pad of his finger.	unchanged
entitle					The Labour Council, elected in 1982, had as a stated policy aim that every child whose parents so wished was entitled to a pre-school place of some sort.	The council argued that a landlord, particularly one such as a local authority, can not realistically be expected to have a system of inspection of all its premises and in practice is entitled to depend upon notification by its tenants.	unchanged
furnish					In Mike's office, furnished with heavily varnished Victorian club furniture.	His concern was solely with effectiveness rather than style; he rarely spoke with more than brief notes and left it to the occasion to furnish the words.	unchanged
flee					You'd fled us !	Grizel Huntley reached out to comfort her but she forced back her chair and fled, clutching her handbag and napkin, leaving her mother with the ruins of lunch.	unchanged
capture					But the hatred they aroused meant that they were liable to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards.	The Dear Report on Handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks :	unchanged
interweave					In essence, the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one, these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities.	Interwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate Latin American culture from that of Europe and North America.	unchanged
stroke					He traced the contours of her face with gentle fingers, outlining the curve of her mouth, stroking her temples.	My name, he stroked her with his voice, is Jesse Isambard Sweetman.	unchanged
suit					Miss Williams's natural pitch, well suited to reaching across a hunting-field, was discreetly reduced.	They represent a time when either their objects were not the same as those of the official organization, or the CCO was not enterprising enough to suit them.	unchanged
prescribe					The doctor refused to give her more sleeping tablets but scribbled a prescription for tranquillizers, which were increasingly prescribed for women like Clare, with symptoms of anxiety in stressful situations such as poverty, divorce, or bereavement; women with marital problems and women who were out of work also found them helpful, although the pills did nothing to resolve the problem responsible for the initial anxiety.	A doctor doesn't ask his patient what treatment to prescribe.	unchanged
tip					went and got the lemonade so I was tipping it in, so Terry goes, he goes I'll have it all !	My friend Kevin, muscleman and minicab driver, says the lads would be out rioting for Willy now if it wasn't tipping down with rain the whole time.	unchanged
usher					He took the Englishman by the arm and ushered him toward the easy chairs arranged around a long rectangular coffee table.	The increased scale of operations also ushered in another fashion of the 1980s new management structures.	unchanged
promote					Scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment.	Urban II, launching the First Crusade at Clermont in 1095, presented it as a natural evolution of the peace movement : warriors were to forget their petty feuds and squabbles in a campaign to promote the interests of Holy Church.	unchanged
grip					There's no reason why they shouldn't be funny or gripping even if they don't use many words.	He rejects charges that he was partly responsible for the casino atmosphere that gripped US corporate life in the early 1980s.	unchanged
suspect					In 1985 the management of Somerset Probation Service was faced with the fact that nearly one in three of the offenders supervised in their area were either known to be or suspected of misusing alcohol (Singer, 1985).	If the animal lived on the sea bottom, it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking downwards, and we begin to suspect that the animal habitually dwelt above the sea floor.	unchanged
issue					West Germans will then issue new ones.	The Declaration of Independence issued by the Palestine National Council (PNC) on November 15 last year constitutes a major landmark along this road.	unchanged
emerge					Questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical in terms of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications.	In an old garden, there may be a fruit tree, or a good bulwark of evergreen laurel or box that, tidied up, could add a dash of venerability to the new garden that will emerge around it.	unchanged
lean					The pale golden head leaned forward towards the grey and Miss Mair whispered.	I know the little boys lean on her too much and I would have gone if I could.	unchanged
convert					Since remote sensing data sets (especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate, transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful (e.g. land cover) data, the processing power required is going to be formidable.	A 1985 Lancia Y10 (lead only) sells for around Ì´å£2,000 whereas the similar Fiat Uno 55 from the same year, converted to run on unleaded, is worth around Ì´å£500 more.	unchanged
launch					Launch the lifeboat, take our chances, or two, we go after whatever it is.	Their value in battle, as shields behind which the knights could shelter before they launched their charge, ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them notably Henry II of England.	unchanged
drift					As it was, the smokeless shimmer of vapour was so cooled by cleaning that it drifted across the river to cause mischief with the leadwork on Wren's great dome.	This was by no means an accident, since throughout the 1970s a powerful body of media, political, and academic opinion had been constructed around the theme of how Britain was drifting into a violent society, and how the basis of consent was being shifted by the pressures of immigration and the growth of multi-racial inner city areas.	unchanged
consume					They learn about the relative strength of different drinks, the amount which is safe to consume, and the pitfalls to avoid (e.g. competitive drinking and buying rounds) (p. 37, para. 7.11).	The selectors knew they were playing with fire when they decided to arrange a couple of club fixtures and they have duly been consumed in a conflagration of their own making.	unchanged
sing					She sings much better than she talks.	So here he was, a distinguished public man, also an artist of a kind, stepping obediently through Room I (French 1880s) and Room II (British 1880s and 1890s), on a lead grey morning, to the pale grey, classical, quiet place where the bright light shone and sang off pigment so that the phrase, miraculous stuff, seemed merely accurate.	unchanged
score					The odds are favourable enough according to Chelsea's Mike Hazard, who said of his adversary : He could cope in Poland, not just because of his ability to close people down and use the ball well, but temperament you saw when he scored the goal that won Arsenal the League.	Bunn, who scored six goals in the previous round against Scarborough, this time turned into the provider, putting Milligan clear and free.	unchanged
admit					I must admit I like a shower but then again I do like the chance to have a bath now and again	At Bridgend he looked in despair, and he almost admitted as much : I hope we can pull it together but sometimes I have my doubts.	unchanged
compete					He was elected to succeed Gaston Mullegg as President of FISA when he was 33 and still competing in the Swiss rowing team.	First, it would consolidate the structures of the developing national authority which is competing to replace the occupation authority.	unchanged
discover					Or they may have been hunters after larger prey, in which case when appendages are eventually discovered they may prove to have adaptations for grasping and manipulating larger food.	Meadowell has even discovered a new martyr in the shape of one Willy Hunter, a local hard nut awaiting trial for murder, and allegedly the victim of a police frame-up.	unchanged
peel					On the floor a toddler peels more chips from a congealed, bluish mass and feeds them to a baby.	The empty dress, a peeling poster of Mae West and in the far distance the Statue of Liberty.	unchanged
govern					Improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total Earth system;	In situations of this kind provisions governing access and format may exert powerful constraints on the use that can be made of these data.	unchanged
block					He's, er, one artery was seventy percent blocked, it was in the paper.	Scaup must be just about the loneliest farm in England, tucked down in the shelter of the hills with Kielder Forest's dark mass blocking its southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn filling half the sky to the north.	unchanged
unfold					She dug into her pocket, unfolded a bit of newspaper, and read, Sportsman Jim Clark today opened a splendidly equipped physical training college at Larkwood in Wiltshire, formerly the family home of the O'Dare family.	In the sections to follow the stark question is therefore put Is the Probation Service in the business of inflicting pain ? and the answer which unfolds may be summarized No, because it neither aspires nor wishes to !	unchanged
liberate					Amaldi dodged the American invitation, perhaps because (with Rome liberated) Fermi's mantle in physics had fallen on his young shoulders and there were younger minds to teach.	Villages and refugee camps were thus being developed into liberated or independent areas, if not militarily, then at least psychologically, politically and infrastructurally.	unchanged
endorse					Thus, at the global scale, the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) has endorsed the setting up of the International Geosphere Biosphere Project (IGBP) to describe and understand the interactive physical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the total Earth system, the unique environment it provides for life, the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions (Report of ad hoc Planning Group for IGBP 1986, quoted in IGBP 1988).	Although the policy review will be endorsed by the conference, giving Neil Kinnock the freedom to go on to the offensive against the Conservatives in the run-up to the next general election, there are a number of areas of potential conflict.	unchanged
abandon					Then he climbed into the Land Rover beside his two passengers and drove off fast, with the aim of abandoning Jamie to the custody of his aunt as quickly as possible.	But it will not mean that we are abandoning them.	unchanged
guide					They were beginning to attract a penumbra of gallery-goers, as though they were offering a guided tour.	That will be the guiding light of the next Labour government.	unchanged
belong					We are not going to enquire into the details how such beams can be produced (it belongs to the subject of physical electronics); we shall accept the fact that the beam exists and will try to work out the forces on the outermost electrons.	THIS expanded network of popular committees and institutions making up the Unified leadership is infused by tens of thousands of activists who belong to, or identify with, the different factions of the PLO.	unchanged
jerk					I put his age at forty, but even among men twenty years younger he would have been accounted handsome, and he knew it, for his expression showed both confidence and amusement as he continued to hold Ellen's hand, and he showed even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty she was thus granting him and jerked her fingers swiftly away.	The head jerked, just the once, to the left, so I reckon it heard the phone.	unchanged
connect					They helped him kit up, Nell connecting the leads from the back pack into the suit attachments.	Fifties and post-impressionist, thought Alexander, connecting.	unchanged
conquer					In the end, it was not in Outremer but in the newly conquered Byzantine empire that the Flemish crusading achievement was crowned with the elevation of Count Baldwin IX to the imperial throne in 1204.	Precautions will not conquer empires, they will not build great cities, they will not transmute dreams into gold or carry men across wide oceans, and precautions will not, emphatically not, win fair ladies, and here he turned to Ellen and lasciviously dropped his gaze to her long bare legs.	unchanged
vibrate					Oh was it vibrating ?	And now he was passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox and it struck him that the whole headland had the desolate look of an old battlefield, the corpses long since carted away but the air vibrating still with the gunfire of long-lost battles, while the power station loomed over it like a grandiose modern monument to the unknown dead.	unchanged
extract					The need, at least with data on the terrestrial environment, for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary (and often proxy) data;	It was usual to extract some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from being enforced.	unchanged
rattle					Get your coat and we'll rattle it, ah, your keys are there.	We rattled them from the first minute and didn't give them any breathing space.	unchanged
thin					Like many hirsute men he had thinned a little on top where once his black fur had been extravagant, but he had a plentiful and prickling black beard, and his body was still compact and very heavy.	Turnout at the last election was around 50 per cent, and with the thinning of the electoral roll brought by the poll tax, will be even lower this time.	unchanged
reach					The loveliest, to my mind, is Melford Hall, whose charming, octagonal Jacobean gatehouse is reached along an avenue of clipped yew trees and, with its high windows flooding the octagon with light, is my fantasy of the ideal study.	He thought, I know what my idea of heaven would be, if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to pass eternity : a sanctuary where one might chain-smoke without impairment of breathing, destruction of the lungs or damage to the heart, light each fresh cigarette from the glowing butt of its predecessor, and drink ice-free but hundred-proof chilled vodka laced with two drops of angostura and a gill of newly opened Perrier endlessly, with increasing euphoria until a peak of joy and ease was reached but without any sub-sequent nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion	unchanged
supervise					The final interview entails a personalized review of the course, as well as the formulation of a follow-up plan to be undertaken with the offender's supervising officer.	In recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources to supervising the more serious and persistent offenders.	unchanged
correct					With no trace of a smile or a blush the baroness quickly corrected herself an irrigation system but the slip was a telling one, and I'm sure they would have appreciated it in Bangladesh.	The only problem was if he corrected himself when it came, which side turning, if any, would it use.	unchanged
initiate					It was initiated partly in response to the furore caused by Enoch Powell's 1969 rivers of blood speech, much as disturbances at the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival prompted further steps on the part of the Department of the Environment A riot makes a much bigger impact on government thinking, as Donnison (1987) has pointed out, than any amount of earnest and accurate research.	Action is initiated by the service of an abatement notice requiring remedial work.	unchanged
amuse					Peter Yeo was amused by, and respectful of, a man with an obsession.	His face was old and young, sardonic and knowing, amused and handsome; the face of a man who has seen the world's wickedness and knows how to match it with his own.	unchanged
tumble					the rain came down and the floods came up and the house on the rocks slid down, but the foolish man built his house upon the sand, the foolish man built his house upon the sand, the foolish man built his house upon the sand and the rain came tumbling down	Dirty grey clouds tumbled across the sky above the slate roof, now the only thing that shone, glazed with rain.	unchanged
destine					Among those leaving was Cornelia, 22, a young East Berliner destined, she said, for West Berlin via a very circuitous route.	Well Loaded Much talked-about guitar rockers, generally regarded as destined for the bigger stadia of life, unless they self-destruct en route.	unchanged
persist					Someone from the village, you said, Lewis persisted.	(Though in Van Gogh's case, the names, Theodorus, Vincent, Vincent, Theodorus, appeared and reappeared from generation to generation, the cultural parallels to certain persisting aspects of the family face, a heavy brow, an intense blue eye, a cheek bone, a nostril.)	unchanged
fold					Under his arm he carried a folded newspaper with that day's headline : PEACE MOTHER DIES.	Sorge didn't stir, even when they mentioned the gruesome spectacle of Trimmler's arms folded in the sign of a swastika.	unchanged
harden					However, many cars built within the last few years have hardened valve seats, or alloy cylinder heads that need little (simply a retune) or no modification to use unleaded petrol.	He hardened his opposition to both, despite the fact that his own party chairman had once favoured the first, and vocal forces within his Scottish party were in support of the second.	unchanged
locate					For example, in 1692, the whole of southern England was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now Belgium; a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted (Morse 1983).	First, it distanced the riots from the social, economic, political, and other grievances which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the social problems of inner-city dwellers and in the simple greed of the drug barons to accumulate loot.	unchanged
dream					She swung lithely down to Dream Baby's gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hulls.	Maybe it's the only thing they ever dreamt about.	unchanged
defeat					In 1964 the All Blacks defeated Leinster 11-5, they won 17-8 in 1972 and scraped home 8-3 in 1974.	Jennifer sounded defeated, and he looked at her sideways with familiar love and exasperation.	unchanged
possess					The AEC is primarily intended for young adults subject to a probation order with a special condition of attendance (Schedule 11 4A(II) Criminal Justice Act 1982) and reflects the fact that most Somerset offenders in trouble through drink commit serious offences and/or possess a substantial number of previous convictions.	In practice however the beam is not uniform and does not possess perfect cylindrical symmetry.	unchanged
chart					WHO TO WATCH While the best that chart music can manage in the way of band names is Black Box, the pub circuit has always been ripe with imaginative handles.	An earlier film by Raphael, The Persuaders (1986), charted the transformation of Ricki into Rytasha, which occurred at the Hare Krishna Temple in London, and her uneasy relationship with her guru there.	unchanged
lock					Without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him, closed the front door after her without locking it and got into the car.	and some sit in, you know, it's locked.	unchanged
undo					Probably dropped in when we were shaking them in the bowl, Rice Krispies seemed to get everywhere, undo the thing and there's Rice Krispies everywhere,	Sometimes he still saw the brushstrokes, as it were, in this naked way, so that his earlier thoughts of this garden had to be undone, the idea of black wings to be stripped from the painted leafage, the vulgar idea of blood splashes washed off the notation of geraniums.	unchanged
wave					He pulled the dog close to him to let a mixed string of horses and Ponies go past, waving shyly to the lead rider, a pretty, capable girl an unbridgeable two years older than him.	Closet countrysiders may want to pretend their patch is actually a corner of some Sussex meadow and picture it swagged with honeysuckle and waving with ox-eye daisies and scabious.	unchanged
release					At present, the executive takes decisions to release some murderers after only a few years and to keep others in prison for extremely long periods.	Properties continued to shine as British Land produced a complicated scheme to release the value of its property portfolio.	unchanged
overtake					One answer sometimes given is that they are not, because a driver who overtakes on a bend, knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction, should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue.	FADS for vitamin supplements have been overtaken by a vogue for minerals and trace elements.	unchanged
surge					Hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the USA.	Relief surged through her like a physical infusion of new blood.	unchanged
opt					Some in the profession of political commentating would opt for Bagehot as their formative influence, but mine has long been Sir David a founder of biased Tory journalism.	She pledged that the Government would safeguard those that did not opt for trust status, but she expected this to be a minority.	unchanged
cease					The trade union question would cease to haunt the Labour Party and while that might upset some Conservatives it would be good for the country.	A mile above the shepherd's hut the hillsides ceased their upward rolling and curved together to form a dead-end valley of broad-breasted slopes five miles from the nearest tarmac road, hidden deep in the folds of the moors.	unchanged
acquiesce					A good many men came into the room by no means inclined to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement.	Labour would be acquiescing in a democratic outrage if it continued arguing that, because the Conservatives had got away with being undemocratic for so long, it was now Labour's turn.	unchanged
defy					He stared into my eyes, challenging me to defy him, and when I did not move he looked back to Ellen.	The technique of hunt the analogue is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists, but it is certainly not a foolproof one, because there are many fossil animals that defy comparison with living organisms, and some analogues do not stand up to detailed scrutiny.	unchanged
contribute					Jacobson and Price (1990) provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to, and are affected by, likely global changes; in particular, they stress the importance of the data-handling issues and the role of GIS in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation.	Aggreko generator hire, Salvesen's world market leader which provides power for customers from pop concerts to the oil industry, contributed strongly to a 37 per cent growth in trading profits in the industrial services division.	unchanged
bypass					and probably because because of his father and er the the other relative having the bypasses done.	They came into the possession of my son Hilbert John Adam Verne-Smith under my uncle's will, bypassing myself, though my son was no more than nineteen at the time of my uncle's death.	unchanged
spark					Mr Sparks doesn't think it's going to pass.	She had been on his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse; frightened yet defiant, sparking with anger.	unchanged
bury					Bones, skeletons, bodies, do not bury themselves.	She dropped to the ground again and lay down, burying her face in the sweet-smelling grass.	unchanged
bounce					Don't bounce when you're eating please.	The theory is that its internal air pocket will bounce back the dolphin's sonar signal, regardless of the direction of approach.	unchanged
reproduce					Moreover, the advent of low-cost, high-density-storage devices like CD-ROMs may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power : a CD-ROM, for instance, can hold about 600 megabytes (i.e. 10&sup6; bytes), can be reproduced currently for about Ì´å£1 and read on a device costing about Ì´å£400.	The International Ergonomics Association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in Edholm (1967).	unchanged
threaten					A fairly typical set of facts is provided by Nedrick (1986), where D had a grudge against a woman and had threatened to burn her out.	The achievements of Raymond IV St Gilles in consolidating his authority within Toulouse were threatened by his departure in 1095, especially since it was known that he had no intention of returning home.	unchanged
bow					Ellen, usually so quick with a scornful reply, just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her, took her hand, then bowed above her fingers.	It was raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery, the pines bowing and shivering in the wind.	unchanged
maintain					There are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability (except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost).	John of Marmoutier's life of Geoffrey le Bel offers a glimpse of how strong bonds were created between the prince and his followers within the household, and how a high level of training was maintained at all times.	unchanged
decline					But he declined further comment.	Of course, I know perfectly well why the Department of the Environment declines to list it.	unchanged
flung					In the passage, she stumbled and almost fell, then flung back the door to the bedroom.	The undemonstrative Miranda flung her arms around the instructor.	unchanged
manoeuvre					After they reached two thousand feet, the instructor showed her how to fly level; he then encouraged her to experiment with the stick, manoeuvring the plane m every direction.	The solid uncooperative bundle was surprisingly heavy; it was like trying to manoeuvre a firm and rather smelly poultice.	unchanged
assert					In many quarters it is asserted that the Unionist Press are treated with greater courtesy by the Radicals than by their own side. "	The rhetoric of the Tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisations of colonial trauma, and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance.	unchanged
bore					A bloody good thing or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore.	The only incongruous note was a cheap round badge, enamelled in red and yellow, that he wore on his shirt, which bore the legend Just Say No !.	unchanged
testing					The use of role play, incorporating previously discussed difficulties (i.e. homework assignment session 4) in real or set up situations provides an opportunity for testing these skills.	Furthermore, it highlights the suitability of referring to this type of project for testing out the appropriateness of applying the notion of punishment to probation practice.	unchanged
smash					They were smashing shops and burning cars and what	It would also be necessary to smash the decrepit, effete constitution that allows a minority to capture power, and then use it ruthlessly in the interests of the privileged few.	unchanged
donate					However, significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain : thus IBM UK Ltd has donated Ì´å£3.5m. of computing equipment to UNEP and IBM in general is actively supporting other R&D which can be expected to facilitate sustainable development : IBM Europe, for instance, has invested $16m. in its Bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development.	So far they have received nothing from the Government, little EC assistance and are running out of funds donated by individuals and industry.	unchanged
assign					Since the latter are available for a 5 km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the OS grid reference.	One can't usually assign some arbitrary value to the divergence of a vector function.	unchanged
swap					want to swap it over	Clare still swapped one night a week off with Stephanie and reported subsequent events to Gilda, who now managed the shoe shop : occasionally she visited Clare for an evening meal.	unchanged
hunt					Those who broke their word were hunted down.	In the first of a monthly series, Michael Jackson hunts in vain	unchanged
transfer					They could transfer me to Detroit, or somewhere.	Just as Thomson transferred Stein's literary abstraction to music, so these portraits unusually employ the painter's technique of drawing the sitter from life : an ideal combination of Thomson's habit of immediate response with an actual subject.	unchanged
colour					Oh you're colouring Postman Pat.	Since popular ideas of life in the past are often founded on vividly coloured reconstructions of The World in the Jurassic Period and the like, it is important to remember that these imaginative scenes are all inferences from bones, and similar fragments.	unchanged
warm					The tiny single room was jammed with the mossy timbers of disused sheep pens, but the little iron fire grate that once warmed the hardy men who worked here was still set in the foot of the hut's tottering gable end, and the massive stone lintel had not yet fallen from its place above the doorway.	Cold-blooded animals have to warm up before they can be fully active; that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates.	unchanged
reside					Being an undergraduate at the time, my son naturally never considered actually residing in the house.	The punitive approach anticipated for the Probation Service in the White Paper is underpinned by a definition of punishment that resides in the restrictions on liberty and in the enforcement of the orders.	unchanged
satisfied					For example, are we satisfied that the 600 deaths recorded as homicide are in fact more culpable than all, or even most, of the deaths recorded as accidents ?	What of this thirst that can be satisfied by an unquenching drink ?	unchanged
strain					The boy had been told unequivocally not to let her off the lead the riding-school only used the land by grace of its owner and it was a shooting estate but he hated keeping the dog straining at the lead and knew that she would always come to his call.	Here a right turn took him off the coastal road on to what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditches and fringed by a golden haze of reeds, their lumbered heads straining in the wind.	unchanged
label					A 4-year experimental programme to collect, co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the European Communities was set up and labelled CORINE.	One answer sometimes given is that they are not, because a driver who overtakes on a bend, knowingly taking the risk that there is a car travelling in the opposite direction, should not be labelled a murderer if a collision and death happen to ensue.	unchanged
embrace					Then he sat on her bed and, without a word from either of them, she went willingly into his arms and was held close in his embrace.	Wearing jeans and a blue shirt, she was tugging at a filing cabinet which was too large for her to embrace and which was threatening to over-balance on her.	unchanged
obscure					Leaves and yellow blossoms obscured the top of the window, while the bottom was covered by aggressive pink hollyhocks, seemingly determined to fight their way inside.	What is obscured by this process is that it was through clothing, in both art and life, that Kahlo attempted to redress the wrongs of history.	unchanged
detach					In the stroboscopic view, the giant pistons were the only things moving until a figure detached itself from the wall, its grey colour exactly that of the background steel.	Their respective positions explain this in part : as ex-Prime Minister and a considerable figure in his own right, Balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party; as the tertium quid in the recent contest, Law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view.	unchanged
underwent					RENEE HENRY underwent a lumpectomy and radiotherapy for her breast cancer.	The room in which they were sitting underwent the curious shrinking process to which it was subject whenever he was reminded of Wyvis Hall or his Uncle Hilbert or even if the county of Suffolk were mentioned.	unchanged
drag					Theresa gave him a brief, pitying smile, dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while, with the other hand, she collapsed the pushchair, with a single vigorous shake.	On and on it dragged.	unchanged
dash					It was Grizel Huntley's own view that her brother had not been fooled at all but had been charmed and diverted by a dashing girl thirty years his junior, and had seen no reason at all why she should not have a share of his considerable estate when that left a very decent down-setting for his niece as well.	A sudden gust of rain dashed against the red bricks that were already stained in patches by water.	unchanged
postpone					A pukka building was duly erected, but its medical function has somehow been indefinitely postponed.	Television had postponed Manchester United's scheduled visit to Anfield so it could be shown live on 22 December, the longest night.	unchanged
exclude					This, however, was too much for the Government and, using the excuse that public opinion was not yet ready to accept the protection of many unpopular modern buildings, Lord Caithness, the Minister of State for the Environment, arbitrarily whittled down English Heritage's list to 18 buildings - excluding Bankside although it represented a more traditional approach in the Fifties to the now-unfashionable Modern Movement.	There was then an open toughness about party tactics; before the Buckingham Palace Conference in 1914 he had Central Office work out the electoral effects of excluding nine, six or four counties of Ulster from an independent Ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot.	unchanged
hammer					He winced at the memory as he hammered on the steel and then looked through the spy port.	The predatory Ritchie chested the ball down and hammered a volley past Lukic.	unchanged
attract					Naturally, if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well, i.e. owing to the magnetic force on the electrons, there is also an inward force upon the ions.	A new Urban Development Grant was devised, to pump-prime with public funds schemes which would then attract private investment.	unchanged
challenging					He stared into my eyes, challenging me to defy him, and when I did not move he looked back to Ellen.	In Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair (1944) (Fig. 6), she paints herself wearing Rivera's suit, challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority (while simultaneously) threatening castration).	unchanged
aspire					Task analysis has not and can not be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course.	In the sections to follow the stark question is therefore put Is the Probation Service in the business of inflicting pain ? and the answer which unfolds may be summarized No, because it neither aspires nor wishes to !	unchanged
stretch					Hazard research, like few other GIS application areas, is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related areas such as expert systems and simulation studies.	Outside Flanders, Robert's sister's marriage to Roger of Sicily was a mark of his new position in the world; like Louis VI's sister's marriage to Bohemond of Antioch, it stretched French kinship connections into the new Norman colonies, ensuring that travellers from the homeland would find a welcome in those distant parts.	unchanged
amount					Systematic collections were made from peers and from the City; by the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted to $671,000 twice the sum in 1911 and worth four years " expenditure and there was a special cash deposit of Ì´å£120,000 for the coming election.	Although many deaths arise from natural causes, and many others from illnesses and diseases, each year sees a large number of deaths caused by accidents, and also a number caused by acts or omissions which amount to some form of homicide in English law.	unchanged
entrust					He quoted the Second Vatican Council : The task of giving an authentic interpretation of the Word of God has been entrusted to the living teachting office of the Church alone.	In procedural terms, therefore, the life sentence involves a transfer of function : normally it is the judge who determines the sentence (or at least its upper limit, since earlier release on parole may be possible), whereas a life sentence entrusts that function to the executive, who must first ascertain the opinions of the Lord Chief Justice and the trial judge.	unchanged
deploy					Delaney took risks, plummeting feet first through the hatchways, and partly breaking his descent with the handrails, falling like a parachutist, rolling instantly deploying his Uzi against	Even the Daily Mail, which deployed the clearest use of race and outside agitator arguments, ran a major story on Broadwater Farm under the headline : Burnt-out hulks litter this concrete jungle despair hangs heavy (8 October 1985).	unchanged
debate					But other aspects of the dinosaur living habits are still more strongly debated.	It was within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished, that young men learned to identify, their vassalage towards their lord as a symbol of their honour, that they debated the relative merits of Roland's and Oliver's way of displaying loyalty; and that they learned the finer points of jousting.	unchanged
leaf					The agency will keep the tenant's deposit until the tenant leaves.	A less direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaves or joins a company.	unchanged
caress					Without any hurry, in spite of the impatience which had brought him here, he caressed the length of her neck and the slope of her shoulders.	Be still my restless heart, the man had a strong, caressing voice and the slow luscious accent of America's deep south.	unchanged
denounce					Meanwhile bad housing, bad sanitation, lack of education, and other perennial ills associated with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leaders and social reformers.	The NAACP denounces The Silence of the Lambs because Hannibal the Cannibal shares his name with an African general, and the killer is Buffalo Bill (yes, that's a white man's nickname, but the buffalo, NAACP explain patiently, is associated with Native Americans).	unchanged
activate					You know which one it, it is, it sort of activated one.	Harsh measures putting an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous lengthy period of time, demolishing homes, uprooting olive or citrus trees, physical intimidation and terror tactics employed by raiding army units, shooting, killing, cutting off water or electricity supplies and telephone links to villages or towns, mass arrests, intimidatory interrogation techniques can either create a temporary lull or activate an eruption.	unchanged
accommodate					She took it for granted that each knew who the other was, and standing aside to motion him in she said : It's good of you to be so accommodating, Mr Dalgliesh.	The type of sediment and the associated fossils will show whether the environment was marine, freshwater or terrestrial, providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal has to be accommodated.	unchanged
sprinkle					You had heroes scotch-taped to their horses and lightly sprinkled with dust.	Why, though, could these supposed championship contenders not have tried to emulate the fine passing that had sprinkled the previous weekend's Merseyside joust ?	unchanged
stem					The little circlets of flat leaves born at regular intervals on the jointed stems serve to distinguish this plant from others in the Carboniferous coal-shales. 8 cm long.	The impossibility stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of Kahlo's choice of clothing, a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances.	unchanged
approach					Oh which way are we approaching it ?	He paused, reminding McLeish irresistibly of a Labrador wondering how best to approach an acquaintance.	unchanged
tread					Large boulders stood out beside the path as grey blobs in the featureless sheets of pale grass, and flat stones had been placed as bridges across the burns, their backs hollowed by the tread of feet through the centuries.	Do not let anybody, particularly gardening writers, tread on your dreams.	unchanged
hurl					Knowing that Adam was probably in the elevator on his way to the beach, Buzz hurled herself out of the kitchen and ran upstairs.	Way you go, Patty, he said softly, and the dog was off, hurling herself along the embankment, all paws and flying ears, after a rabbit who had been sitting in a patch of sun but disappeared with contemptuous ease as she came close.	unchanged
trade					It may be wise, while retaining or regaining control, to trade under different names.	It was a cold reminder of their world, of the business they traded in daily.	unchanged
rejoice					She adaws Bangladesh, gushed Rytasha's mother the fiercest matron of them all, rejoicing in the improbable title of Baroness Thea von Theilheimer Shenkman.	One result was the triumphant expansion of some charitable organizations, which rejoiced both at their new-found importance and at the Government's munificence.	unchanged
mark					Marking out boundaries.	If you are a dedicated sun-worshipper, you need to mark out the part of the garden where the sun lingers longest.	unchanged
devoted					In recent years the probation service has devoted increasing resources to supervising the more serious and persistent offenders.	It is devoted instead to the worship of the charitable Rytasha, who is not content simply to hand over the cash but insists, in an unfortunate hangover from her Hare Krishna days, on posturing as a spiritual master.	unchanged
utter					Mark uttered in mock astonishment.	As if in protest, George uttered a blood-curdling, lunatic-sounding cackle, and fell fractionally forward.	unchanged
